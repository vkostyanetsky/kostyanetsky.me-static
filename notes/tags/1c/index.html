    <div class="f4 lh-copy black mb5">
        <p class="measure-wide">I was developing payment documents in our configuration last week and came across an incredibly redundant solution to a primitive problem. Sorry, I can't keep to myself.</p>
<p class="measure-wide">Just imagine: you have a document, which contains several tabular sections. Each of them has a comment field. You make a print form for this document; if at least one row of any TS contains a comment — you need to use one template 1, if there are no comments — template 2.</p>
<p class="measure-wide">The task is pretty primitive, isn't it? All of us have done something like this a million times. Just read the selection, use IsBlankString() on the comment field and load the appropriate template. Coffee time!</p>
<p class="measure-wide">However, instead of a short cycle I saw this:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/vkostyanetsky/e870d5bb3d2f23d93f3d17001eaef59b.js">Gist</script>
<p class="measure-wide">There is a chain of queries, in the lowest of which we scan all the TS (which, I remind you, we just raked out for printing). We are looking for comments in them, then we group the result several times and return it to the script.</p>
<p class="measure-wide">Well, I'm not even talking about the load on the DBMS (I would venture to guess that this trick doesn't give a noticeable effect — after all, the selection is going to be quite small). It's just… Well… Checking a selection of rows is, like, five lines of code. Clear, simple, short, Sonar has no room to swear. How could you give birth to this? Because of great love for queries?</p>
<p class="measure-wide">You know what? I bet that it's the correct answer. I can almost see this programmer, who has just mastered the query language more or less tolerably. He is in the absolute delight of new opportunities, so… If all you have is a hammer, everything around looks like nails.</p>

            <h2 class="f2 lh-title"><a class="link blue bb dim" href="https://kostyanetsky.me/notes/tags/1c/no-comment/">No Comment</a></h2>

            
    
    <div class="f4 lh-copy black mb5">
        <p class="measure-wide">I did not notice when I gave up the habit of pedantically commenting on every method with which I have to work. This practice has some clever name for sure, but I don't care to be honest. I mean the style when a description is added to every meaningful block of code, like this:</p>
<pre><code>&amp;AtServer
Procedure BobDoSomething()

    // what the code below does, blah blah blah
    (lot of code)

    // what the code below does, blah blah blah
    (lot of another code)

    // what the code below does, blah blah blah
    (lot of code, once again)

EndProcedure // BobDoSomething()
</code></pre>
<p class="measure-wide">The meaning here is simple: when you dig in some dense legacy and run back and forth between chaotically scattered, big procedures - it is rather difficult to keep the logic of each of them in your head. The next cup of coffee will wash everything away. Therefore, such notes greatly speed up orientation on the ground, and the more time passes between approaches to the code, the more noticeable the effect.</p>
<p class="measure-wide">However, at some point it became clear that this know-how is just a crutch supporting the frankly crappy code design. If you have a long procedure or function - take a breath, sit down and cut the fatty one into smaller methods. You will save both time and nerves, and you will figure out the code faster, and you will delight SonarCube.</p>

<p class="measure-wide">On the screenshot above my little one is just letting me know where she is: walking down the street, at the school, at a playground. It's not her fault that I have a sort of nerd view: when I look at this chat I see nothing but code on Gherkin, which is just a bit broken. A little patch here and there and it will be fine :-)</p>
<pre><code>And I exit home
Then I enter school
And I exit school
Then I gonna swing
</code></pre>
<p class="measure-wide">We use Gherkin to write our autotests for <a class="link blue dim bb" href="https://github.com/Pr-Mex/vanessa-automation" target="_blank">Vanessa Automation</a>. I can't say I've made very many of them, especially in comparison with some of my colleagues… Well, it seems like I've made them enough to twist the reality a few.</p>

    <div class="f4 lh-copy black mb5">
        <p class="measure-wide">1C:Enterprise has a convenient and accustomed method of showing information for a user — it's a UserMessage object. It outputs messages at the bottom of a form and suddenly it's a potential problem. The thing is, most users don't look at it. It's like: well, I see no critical errors for now so there is nothing to worry about.</p>
<p class="measure-wide">Therefore, in case an error happens or you just have an essential message, you should show it through a dialogue window — by the ShowQueryBox() method or a ShowMessageBox() method, for example. Otherwise, a user may not notice a problem and continue to work in spite of some action might not be executed or might be executed in a wrong way. The issue will come out later and you will be rightfully blamed for it.</p>
<p class="measure-wide">In addition, using of a UserMessage object should be prohibited in case of small service forms. Yes, in fact, it's hard to overlook a text if a window is small, but that's a different matter: the messages below literally <a class="link blue dim bb" href="https://kostyanetsky.me/notes/message-to-user/en.png" target="_blank">devour</a> form's workspace and it becomes hard to work with.</p>

        <p class="measure-wide">Sometimes when you developing some complex mechanic you don't have enough time time for the adequate naming of variables. As a result, there is a lot of mysterious WhatTheHeck, ApplyMagic and bunch of other LivingFailures.</p>
<p class="measure-wide">It's what you should avoid despite it looks funny. You'll rewrite code you've written month or two later and it will be hard to shame its author because it is you.</p>
