        <p class="measure-wide">Perhaps you already know that Eliezer Yudkowsky's “Methods of Rationality” in Russian is going to be published as a standard book (thanks to “Evolution” and other information partners), but I still want to remind again.</p>
<p class="measure-wide">The book is really good, I had <a class="link blue dim bb" href="https://kostyanetsky.me/notes/hpmor" target="_blank">written</a> about it a couple of years ago. It teaches useful things in such an attractive way that it's really hard to stop reading. The whole text is in public access, but if you want a hard copy — you can <a class="link blue dim bb" href="https://planeta.ru/campaigns/hpmor" target="_blank">make a request</a> now.</p>

            <h2 class="f2 lh-title"><a class="link blue bb dim" href="https://kostyanetsky.me/notes/tags/books/fce-results/">FCE Results</a></h2>

            
    
    <div class="f4 lh-copy black mb5">
        <p class="measure-wide">Cambridge just sent me results of my FCE exam in June and — dramatic drum roll — I passed it! According to the statement of results, I made a bunch of mistakes in writing tasks but particularly took it out during a Speaking test. It's a pity that examiners don't give comments and reasons so it's hard to estimate the results properly; however, it's quite clear what to do next :) My English teacher said that Cambridge used to provide an overall score only earlier and it sounded like “take it any way you want, dear pretenders”.</p>
<p class="measure-wide">Well, I guess I should begin my preparation for CAE in the next year.</p>
<p class="measure-wide">Speaking about languages, I remembered Feynman with his famous “Surely You're Joking”. Among many things, he told that he learned to play on a frigideira when he lived in Brazil and had reached so high level of skill that he served as a model for local musicians.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide">My theory is that it's like a person who speaks French who comes to America. At first they're making all kinds of mistakes, and you can hardly understand them. Then they keep on practicing until they speak rather well, and you find there's a delightful twist to their way of speaking their accent is rather nice, and you love to listen to it.</p>
<p class="measure-wide"><em>― Richard Feynman, ”Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide">As for me, there is a lot of efforts between “all kinds of mistakes” and “love to listen”, but it is such a good synopsis. Working on it!</p>

    <div class="f4 lh-copy black mb5">
        <p class="measure-wide">Just finished reading “Harry Potter and Methods of Rationality” — the epic fanfic based on the you-know-whose universe. An author is a tough specialist in the field of artificial intelligence and interesting on his own, but his book is what I insistently <a class="link blue dim bb" href="http://hpmor.com/" target="_blank">recommend</a> to read.</p>
<p class="measure-wide">First of all, it is the magnificent rethinking of the original saga. Many aspects seem not less fascinating, I may say; moreover, the plot itself is certainly excellent — I read two-thirds of the story without switching <a class="link blue dim bb" href="https://kostyanetsky.me/notes/hpmor/gene-wilder-meme.jpg" target="_blank">Gene Wilder</a> off :-) Nevertheless, the author was skillful enough to make all points meet and finish a storyline in such a pretty way that I had almost nothing to complain about.</p>
<p class="measure-wide">In any case, this book is a well way to meet with a lot of scientific and just interesting things which were mentioned along the way. The author is smart and his book is a smart one too.</p>
