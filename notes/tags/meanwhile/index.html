            <h2 class="f2 lh-title"><a class="link blue bb dim" href="https://kostyanetsky.me/notes/tags/meanwhile/yaga/">Yaga</a></h2>

            
    
    <div class="f4 lh-copy black mb5 measure-wide">
        <p>I accidentally remembered that six months ago, one of my colleagues threw a link to <a href="https://yaga.rt.ru" target="_blank">Yaga</a> into the work chat. It is a future (I guess) competitor of JIRA in Russia. Judging by the URL, the guys from Rostelecom are developing it. Here my curiosity was awakened — how is it there, did it take off?</p>
<p>Alas, but looks like nope. At least, the landing page has the “leave a request and wait for a response beep” vibe. Only a simplified version is available for smaller teams that I can't touch as well: being not in Russia and clicking on the “Start using” button leads me to a ban. Welp, next time, maybe.</p>
<p>The naming is clickbait, of course. But I’m not sure if it’s really a good choice. For example, “1C” may provoke forced jokes (One s! Odin's ass! Haha), but if you google “1C”, you are more likely to find information about the platform or at least the vendor. Not a bunch of articles, fan fiction, fan art, or video games, as in the case of Yaga.</p>
<p>Moreover, some wrong associations come to mind. What does Baba Yaga reminds you of? A hut on chicken legs? It looks like an initially <a href="https://kostyanetsky.me/notes/evolution" target="_blank">poorly designed</a> application that was somehow remade right on production. A mortar? A crutch? Damn, if you look at it from the point of view of programmers — these are not red flags, but real scarlet banners fluttering in the wind :)</p>
<p>One more thing: I'm probably spoiled, but when I hear the word “Yaga”, the first thing that pops into my head is not a powerful witch from Slavic folklore, but <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaguar_(drink)" target="_blank">disgusting booze</a> from the 2000s.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now Baba with Yaga are no longer redneck, but a patriotic programmer!</p>

    <div class="f4 lh-copy black mb5 measure-wide">
        <p>Recently, I took a <a href="https://tough-dev.school/system-analysis" target="_blank">system analysis course</a>, which was taught by the guys from the “School of Strong Programmers”. I have two goals:</p>
<ol>
<li>First, I need to calibrate. I handle a dozen tech stacks that have different tool sets and concepts of beauty. This, of course, is a great development, but it distorts the perspective: I am drawn to solve the next problem, starting with minor technical things, simply because I am good at it. Meanwhile, if you look at the problem a little from above, think about it, and draw some diagrams, you will get a better or at least more meaningful solution. So I want to convince myself to do this more often.</li>
<li>Secondly, I need to learn how to write clear documentation for developers. In practice, I rarely get around to it, and when I do, I don’t have time to keep it up-to-date. In short, time is short, and I would at least like to do the paperwork somehow so that the reader grasps the idea more quickly.</li>
</ol>
<p>The course itself is made in the shape of iterations: every week you are told about the same project that the main character of the story, Ibrahim, is trying to design (that’s him on the landing page in the link above). Every week, there are more and more problems with this project, and the solutions that dude comes up with become more and more intricate.</p>
<p>In addition, students are regularly assigned homework for another project with similar issues. It needs to be analyzed and designed again and again, taking into account the new knowledge and limitations gained over the past week.</p>
<p>So far, it's going great. The main concern is a lack of time. I read relatively slowly and try to take notes on the most captivating or simply difficult passages. Meanwhile, there is a lot of material in the course, and all of it is interesting, even if you count only the main part of the content.</p>
<p>In addition, if you go to the additional links, you can even take away the saints. It takes six months, no less. I tried to read them at least diagonally, but it turned out to be a damn bad idea. I ended up seeing the main character of the course in a street advertisement :)</p>

    <div class="f4 lh-copy black mb5 measure-wide">
        <p>Recently, we came up with the idea of dividing the internal ERP into several independent parts and organizing data exchange between them. We discussed the outlines of the task, the exchange model, transport, and roughly agreed on deadlines — in general, we did what we usually do.</p>
<p>I created a task for the stuff. We give them names in English, so I wrote in the first wording that came to mind.</p>
<p><img alt="Cut My Life Into Pieces" src="https://kostyanetsky.me/notes/last-resort/last-resort.png"/></p>
<p>The title came out with sound. Okay, this one is funny, but what should I call it then? Well, let it be Distributed Internal ERP. Abbreviated... DIE?</p>
<p>I let the first one be. Long live Papa Roach :)</p>

        <p>I was wasting time at the supermarket checkout: it’s evening, there aren’t many customers anymore, but the elderly cashier is clearly tired and isn’t in too much of a hurry. Standing in front a tall, gray-haired man with a luxurious beard whiles away the time studying the rack of chocolates next to the cash register.</p>
<p>Finally, he takes a Snickers, twirls it in his hands thoughtfully. Then he pushes two more towards himself and, broadly, with visible pleasure, smiles into his mustache :)</p>

<p>The feature is regulated differently everywhere: in some countries it just works, but in others registration is possible or even required.</p>

<li>Reunion: yes</li>
<li>Romania: yes (with registration) (but be afraid of Dracula)</li>

<p>I don’t know how else I can explain this cemetery.</p>
<p>UPD: Found the answer. Grave crosses mean you have to pay $700 to register.</p>
<p>To be frank, I like the explanation about Dracula much more.</p>

    <div class="f4 lh-copy black mb5 measure-wide">
        <p>I like to notice things in the world around me that clearly have a story behind them. In video games, this is called “environmental storytelling”: they don’t tell you the story directly, but if you look around, you can guess which gun was hanging on the wall and who fired from it.</p>
<p>For example, I recently celebrated the company's 10th anniversary with colleagues at a local golf club. Balls had to be sent flying from the second floor; there are no railings for obvious reasons, but a net is stretched in case someone loses their balance.</p>
<p><img alt="Photo from the club website to make it clearer." src="https://kostyanetsky.me/notes/environmental-storytelling/topgolf.jpeg"/></p>
<p>Why are you talking about this, you ask? Well, there are warnings on the walls: jump into the net of your own free will and pay <abbr title="About two hundred thousand rubles at this moment.">ten thousand dirhams</abbr>. Recording this heroic leap of faith on camera is fine as well, just prepare five thousand more.</p>
<p>Do you feel the smell of a good history? </p>
<p>Another example: once flew to Turkey to rest and decided, just in case, to look through the rules of the airline (what can be taken on board, what can not). Among the list of items prohibited from being carried on board, I found “steel spear” and “steel flail” 😬</p>
<p>UPD: Another great <a href="https://kostyanetsky.me/notes/environmental-storytelling/soundproof.jpeg" target="_blank">example</a> from somewhere on the Internet.</p>

        <p>For the last month I have been rewriting standard data exchange between FirstBit ERP and Bitrix for a client task. Co-workers doing the same on the Bitrix side prepared a huge mapping for this case: which field on the 1C side should be transferred to which Bitrix field (and vice versa).</p>
<p>They published this mapping as Google Docs tables, in the interface of which you can see users using any document at this moment — both logged in and anonymous. Anonymous ones traditionally are displaying as <a href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/2494888?hl=en" target="_blank">animals</a>.</p>
<p>Colleagues generally prefer to work anonymously. As a result, I definetely used to feel like a Disney princess: you start working in the morning, and anonymous quokkas, penguins and chinchillas roll out from everywhere :-)</p>

        <p>Someone told me about the Croatian comic strips <a href="http://www.to-zo.com/notbut" target="_blank">NOT/BUT</a> at the beginning of last year, when I was seriously learning to draw. Each strip there is about some kind of traumatic or simply gloomy thought that comes into the artist’s head while working. The idea is to push a reader in the right direction and give them a more practical perspective on the situation they're in.</p>
<p>I quit drawing a year later, at the end of February: it became clear that I no longer had time for a hobby. But comics are completely universal; look through, even if you have no idea what a kneaded eraser is :-)</p>

        <p>Yesterday morning, I was buying gifts for my women. While a florist was makings bouquets for me, we had a small talk and I suddenly caught her eye. She was looking at the growing crowd of customers with calmness and a clearly readable shadow of doom. This is probably how sailors looking at a surging wave which is about to bury their boat :-)</p>
<p>People outside the flower industry grin sometimes — they say, eight of March is such a magical holiday for all the florists who make a fortune in ten hours. Well, income is really good these days, but literally anybody who has ever worked in this sphere more often associates the holiday (and a couple of days before it, by the way) with a monstrous strain on health and nerves.</p>
<p>I can say that I got off cheaply: was just deploying and servicing some IT of a local net of flower shops, nothing more (by the way, I want to proudly <a href="http://rosetta.florist/" target="_blank">recommend</a> my former colleagues!). Nonetheless, the smell of flowers caused me Vietnam syndrome for a long time :-)</p>

        <p>There is a good <a href="http://maximilyahov.ru/blog/all/mne-ok/" target="_blank">note</a> from Maxim Ilyahov about a way of analyzing something which doesn't concern you but annoys you anyway. It's reminded me of an American principle of non-judgemental attitude which I read about a couple of years ago. As for me, it uses different words to make the same point.</p>
<p>By the way, this principle presents in Russia too — there is even a famous adage “don't be judgemental so you won't be judged”. What a pity for us that it isn't so widespread yet.</p>

<p>As for me, it's a great illustration for an everlasting moan “why do you always stare at your smartphone blah blah blah”. A reason is quite simple: people have their friends, books, podcasts, games, and YouTube in their smartphones. It's much more fun than a frowning man or a grim women with guru syndrome next to them, for example.</p>
<p>The same is true of children. Social networks are full of arguments about it, but a reason is still the same: if a teenager flips through pictures in his phone in front of you, you bore him and a problem obviously is you.</p>
