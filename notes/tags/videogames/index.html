<p class="measure-wide">The nice release of the “We Are Doomed” IT podcast about developer burnout. No insights, but you can find something useful. For example, what about not switching to pet projects after work, but close your laptop and go for a walk?</p>
<p class="measure-wide">I liked the analogy with video games, somewhere closer to the middle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide">There was such a game — Diablo. RPG, all sorts of spells, you know. A character has mana and health, and when you have no mana to cast… Ha, I sound like a nerd! Well, nevermind. Briefly speaking, when you have no mana to cast, it's taken from your health.</p>

    <div class="f4 lh-copy black mb5">
        <p class="measure-wide">Natalia O'Shea has sung a Jaina's song in a Russian version of a trailer for a future update of World of Warcraft. As for me, she's extraordinary good in it — I mean, she knows how to make a proper mood and season a speech with steel.</p>
<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5j-S448XC8k" width="560"></iframe>
<p class="measure-wide">By the way, speaking about her and “Melnitsa” as a whole thing — all of their most powerful songs are about something particular. We were at a concert dedicated to the “Luciferase” release and it's hard to compare, seriously. Perhaps, I didn't know something essential to understanding a context, but sometimes it was even barely possible to figure out a story which I was hearing.</p>
<p class="measure-wide">Just watch a video I posted under. You don't need to know something special about the World of Warcraft universe, do you? For example, I haven't played WoW and not planning to do it, but the end of the song literally creeps me out :-)</p>

    <div class="f4 lh-copy black mb5">
        <p class="measure-wide">I have <a class="link blue dim bb" href="https://acomics.ru/~sebby-x-player" target="_blank">translated</a> Stardew Valley fan manga on a wave of enthusiasm at the end of July (SV is an enormously addictive farmer simulator which <a class="link blue dim bb" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/413150/Stardew_Valley/" target="_blank">went out</a> a couple of years ago).</p>
<p class="measure-wide">It was an amusing experience. Firstly, an author of the manga is Chinese and her work was already translated from Chinese to English. I'm not sure what was the bigger problem — cultural differences or language skills, but several frames were a bit difficult to understand what's going on. Secondly, I've figured out that it's a real challenge to pick proper Russian words and not to get something like a quote from an official government's letter in the end.</p>
<p class="measure-wide">So, a part of sense had lost during the process, I guess, although I tried to keep everything I could and even had a word with the author in order to solve the most problematic cases. It was quite funny — I don't know Chinese, she doesn't know Russian, so our a bit poor English was the only way to understand each other.</p>
<p class="measure-wide">Something could have been translated better, I suppose, and several pictures definitely could have been changed more accurately. But you know what? Hell it out, perfection is a cruel mistress and I like the result yet. Yeah, there is no big deal or something like it — a drawing style is quite common, a plot has no significant differences with the game, but… I don't know. Perhaps, visual novels made a too sentimental son of a bitch out of me :-)</p>
<p class="measure-wide">Thanks to <a class="link blue dim bb" href="https://vk.com/id54890849" target="_blank">Alice</a> for helping me with image processing, <a class="link blue dim bb" href="https://twitter.com/amish77kin" target="_blank">Lem</a> for helping me with the translation and <a class="link blue dim bb" href="https://vk.com/mahrunteka" target="_blank">Marika</a> for the inspiration. And, sure, thanks to <a class="link blue dim bb" href="https://curayukie.deviantart.com" target="_blank">Quantus</a> for the manga.</p>
