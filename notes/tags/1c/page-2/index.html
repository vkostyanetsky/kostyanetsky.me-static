    <div class="f4 lh-copy black mb5 measure-wide">
        <p>I'll tell you about a funny and a little embarrassing case that I took apart in January. The essence in a nutshell: a huge auto-test based on Vanessa, which is intended to check the VAT calculation, falls somewhere near the end.</p>
<p>I start investigating. First, I look at the screenshots in Allure: OK, the reason is obvious – in one of the documents, the conditional appearance for the field with the VAT amount doesn't work. The test expected it to be unavailable if the VAT rate is zero, but it turned out to be available somehow.</p>
<p>It's a mess, it needs to be fixed! I look at the condition in the code: well, it locks the field if the VAT rate is in the list of “zero” rates (list of VAT rates whose rate is equal to zero). Everything appears to be simple and logical. What the hell could possibly go wrong here?</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/EffinBirds/status/1489980393675702281" target="_blank"><img alt="Tweet" src="https://kostyanetsky.me/notes/reuse-carefully/snap-tweet-EffinBirds-1489980393675702281.png"/></a></p>
<p>Well, I try to reproduce the bug manually. And there, all of a sudden, everything is nice: the conditional appearance works as it should. Floating bug, or what? I run the auto-test again, at the right moment I jump in with the debugger and find some outright garbage: in the list of “zero” rates, besides themselves, there are a bunch of empty links!</p>
<p>Frankly speaking, I was scratching the back of my head. The document receives this list from the common module with <a href="https://gist.github.com/vkostyanetsky/5ec036ee148606aad9caefbc9305bfb0" target="_blank">this code</a>. An empty ref from here, even theoretically, cannot be obtained. Moreover, the module has the “Reuse Return Values” option ​​enabled, and the function is actually executes once somewhere at the beginning of the test, before all complex data manipulations. So, the test cannot affect it in any way, in theory.</p>
<p>Is it a dead end? Well, experienced colleagues have probably already guessed everything, but I had to dance around the bug  and even check the <a href="https://its.1c.ru/db/v8std/content/724/hdoc" target="_blank">standard</a>, until got the following: <strong>return values ​​cache in 1C can be changed</strong>. I mean, not by calling RefreshReusableValues​​(), but by changing reusable values directly.</p>
<p>How? Well, if you get some values ​​from a cached common module, and they are not of a primitive type (string, number, etc.), you will not get the value itself, but a pointer to it somewhere in memory. You write this pointer to a variable and try to change it – you change the cache.</p>
<p>It's that simple, yes. This is what happened in my case: the form of another document called the method that generates the list of “zero” rates. Having received a list of values, it added an empty ref to it and used it in its logic. Thus, each time this form opens, the list cache contains more and more empty refs, which eventually broke the document at the other end of the configuration.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/EffinBirds/status/1488165946342662144" target="_blank"><img alt="Tweet" src="https://kostyanetsky.me/notes/reuse-carefully/snap-tweet-EffinBirds-1488165946342662144.png"/></a></p>
<p>In a good way, the platform should throw exceptions when developer trying to change the cache, but until this happens, you have to take care yourself. For example, when developing cached modules, return immutable data types from them (FixedStructure instead of Structure, FixedArray instead of Array, and so on). True, this is not a 100% protection: firstly, fixed types are not applicable everywhere, and secondly, even in the latest versions of the SSL, this is far from being done everywhere. Do you know many configurations not based on SSL?</p>
<p>Sonar also know nothing about the problem, as well as less popular software. No silver bullet, in short – check your code, look at the code of your colleagues and try not to forget about another elegant way to bang ourselves in the foot.</p>

        <p>Last week I visited Moscow for <a href="https://event.infostart.ru/2021_msk/" target="_blank">Infostart Event 2021</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Listen to numbers of interesting reports — check;</li>
<li>Meet a few cool people in real life — check;</li>
<li>Chat with friends — check!</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result, I suddenly felt rested despite the flights, stress, and fuss. I think it's because I'm working remotely, so it was really cool to look at so many colleagues in real life (not as a stream of electrons, I mean).</p>
<p>In order not to <s>get up</s> to fly twice, I passed the <a href="https://postgrespro.ru/education/exam/DBA1-10" target="_blank">first test</a> for PostgreSQL administration in the PostgresPro office. There are three more tests ahead, and the final one does not exist at all yet — but the walking one will master the road, I guess.</p>

        <p>A few days ago, there was a link to 1Ci certificate in the team chat (a colleague passed their junior <a href="https://academy.1ci.com/courses/1c-junior-developer" target="_blank">course</a>). I go over and see no auth form, no errors — I just get a PDF file. Everything is OK, right? Well, then I open the file:</p>
<p><img alt="Error.pdf" src="https://kostyanetsky.me/notes/matryoshka/not-your-certificate.png"/></p>
<p>Honestly, I am even delighted. We need to implement this UX in our products: you press, for example, the “print” button for a document, and it gives you a PDF! And inside it — a link to another PDF! And inside it — “entity is not filled”, so go fill.</p>
<p>You can sell it as a Russian way of dealing with errors. This is, like, for historical reasons! Blame all the damned matryoshkas, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koschei" target="_blank">Koschei</a> with his needle. It is, as you remember, in the egg, and it is in the duck, which is in the rabbit, tucked into the chest, and further along the chain of nesting.</p>

<p>Threw in my <a href="https://gist.github.com/tonsky/881d5d8c4fbed818fe2905a7591a91e0#file-vkostyanetsky-1c" target="_blank">two cents</a> just to complete the picture. If you forget about stability, readability, and performance — you can cut it in half. Here it was obvious from the very beginning that it would be shorter in bash and clearer in Python, so I just wrote it as I was used to.</p>
<p>What was useful: there are a bunch of examples in other languages ​​in the comments to the post. Frankly speaking, I haven’t come across some of them; it was really curious to look at the syntax and try to understand the way to solve the task.</p>
<p>In general, the whole story reminded Eugene Stepanishev's <a href="https://bolknote.ru/tags/beer99/" target="_blank">hobby</a> — to write the output of the American “beer song” in all languages ​​in a row. By the way, Tonsky's issue looks as fun for me too — too trivial to seriously compare something on its basis.</p>
<p>What was funny: for a couple of <a href="https://t.me/nikitonsky_pub/201?comment=26703" target="_blank">colleagues</a>, the 1C code caused such acute vision problems that they considered it necessary to report it :-) I partly understand the desire to assert itself on the stereotype “1C is bad, mkay?”, but it's the wrong case. The preference in syntax is nothing but a matter of taste, and besides it, the solution in 1C is no different from solutions in any other language without a built-in library for parsing CSV.</p>

        <p>I was developing payment documents in our configuration last week and came across an incredibly redundant solution to a primitive problem. Sorry, I can't keep to myself.</p>
<p>Just imagine: you have a document, which contains several tabular sections. Each of them has a comment field. You make a print form for this document; if at least one row of any TS contains a comment — you need to use one template 1, if there are no comments — template 2.</p>
<p>The task is pretty primitive, isn't it? All of us have done something like this a million times. Just read the selection, use IsBlankString() on the comment field and load the appropriate template. Coffee time!</p>
<p>However, instead of a short cycle, I saw this:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/vkostyanetsky/e870d5bb3d2f23d93f3d17001eaef59b.js">Gist</script>
<p>There is a chain of queries, in the lowest of which we scan all the TS (which, I remind you, we just raked out for printing). We are looking for comments in them, then we group the result several times and return it to the script.</p>
<p>Well, I'm not even talking about the load on the DBMS (I would venture to guess that this trick doesn't give a noticeable effect — after all, the selection is going to be small). It's just… Well… Checking a selection of rows is, like, five lines of code. Clear, simple, short, Sonar has no room to swear. How could you give birth to this? Because of great love for queries?</p>
<p>You know what? I bet that it's the correct answer. I can almost see this programmer, who has just mastered the query language more or less tolerably. He is in the absolute delight of new opportunities, so… If all you have is a hammer, everything around looks like nails.</p>

        <p>I did not notice when I gave up the habit of pedantically commenting on every method with which I have to work. This practice has some clever name for sure, but I don't care, to be honest. I mean the style when a description is added to every meaningful block of code, like this:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/vkostyanetsky/afae4dee09d639f34156d6c02b29c2a5.js">Gist</script>
<p>The meaning here is simple: when you dig in some dense legacy and run back and forth between chaotically scattered, big procedures — it is rather difficult to keep the logic of each of them in your head. The next cup of coffee will wash everything away. Therefore, such notes greatly speed up orientation on the ground, and the more time passes between approaches to the code, the more noticeable the effect.</p>
<p>However, at some point it became clear that this know-how is just a crutch supporting the frankly crappy code design. If you have a long procedure or function - take a breath, sit down and cut the fatty one into smaller methods. You will save both time and nerves, and you will figure out the code faster, and you will delight SonarCube.</p>

        <p>1C:Enterprise has a convenient and accustomed method of showing information for a user — it's a UserMessage object. It outputs messages at the bottom of a form and suddenly it's a potential problem. The thing is, most users don't look at it. It's like: well, I see no critical errors for now so there is nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>Therefore, in case an error happens or you just have an essential message, you should show it through a dialogue window — by the ShowQueryBox() method or a ShowMessageBox() method, for example. Otherwise, a user may not notice a problem and continue to work in spite of some action might not be executed or might be executed in a wrong way. The issue will come out later and you will be rightfully blamed for it.</p>
<p>In addition, using of a UserMessage object should be prohibited in case of small service forms. Yes, in fact, it's hard to overlook a text if a window is small, but that's a different matter: the messages below literally <a href="https://kostyanetsky.me/notes/message-to-user/en.png" target="_blank">devour</a> form's workspace and it becomes hard to work with.</p>

        <p>Sometimes when you developing some complex mechanic you don't have enough time time for the adequate naming of variables. As a result, there is a lot of mysterious WhatTheHeck, ApplyMagic and bunch of other LivingFailures.</p>
<p>It's what you should avoid despite it looks funny. You'll rewrite code you've written month or two later and it will be hard to shame its author because it is you.</p>
