That blew my mind, to be frank.</p>\n<p>Today, my colleague and I were fixing a 1C cluster with databases running on 1cFresh. After migrating it to a neighboring server, the thing suddenly started acting up. Long story short: trying to print a document would send the client app into its death throes.  </p>\n<p>While we were knee-deep in troubleshooting, I had this thought: sure, it doesn’t look as terrifying as debugging software that someone’s life literally depends on. But if you think about all the clients sitting on edge because their business is grinding to a halt... Well, who knows where the stress levels are higher?  </p>\n<p>P.S. Nerdy details for the curious. During the migration, the permissions for the server cache folder didn’t transfer properly. This led to a funny (well, not so funny) effect: the logs would happily land there, but session data wouldn’t.  </p>\n<p>So, when someone opened a print form, the configuration tried saving it to the storage, and rphost, in turn, attempted to shove it into the session cache. Here’s where things went sideways: the worker' process (probably) got slapped on the wrist by the OS. Due to (apparently) some funky file system event handling in the platform, the exception wasn’t caught, so the poor thing had no better idea than to kill the session.

    "text": "a little bit of surgery 17 december 2024 · 1с work a few years ago, i stumbled upon a story about a programmer who had to debug software controlling a surgical robot — right in the middle of an operation. that blew my mind, to be frank. today, my colleague and i were fixing a 1c cluster with databases running on 1cfresh. after migrating it to a neighboring server, the thing suddenly started acting up. long story short: trying to print a document would send the client app into its death throes. while we were knee-deep in troubleshooting, i had this thought: sure, it doesn’t look as terrifying as debugging software that someone’s life literally depends on. but if you think about all the clients sitting on edge because their business is grinding to a halt... well, who knows where the stress levels are higher? p.s. nerdy details for the curious. during the migration, the permissions for the server cache folder didn’t transfer properly. this led to a funny (well, not so funny) effect: the logs would happily land there, but session data wouldn’t. so, when someone opened a print form, the configuration tried saving it to the storage, and rphost, in turn, attempted to shove it into the session cache. here’s where things went sideways: the worker' process (probably) got slapped on the wrist by the os. due to (apparently) some funky file system event handling in the platform, the exception wasn’t caught, so the poor thing had no better idea than to kill the session. naturally, this caused the client process to crash. we fixed the permissions, rebooted the cluster, and voilà! the problem was gone. all other hypotheses — cluster manager acting up, lack of hardware resources, configuration bugs, client-side issues, broken security profiles, network problems between the client and server — got tossed out during the diagnostics process."

It is an intermittent fasting tracker that adds a new code block to your vault: you enter the start date of the fasting interval and get the date of its finish, the time until this moment, and a list of the zones to be passed.</p>\n<p>The block shows an up-to-date picture every time Obsidian renders it, which means you can monitor your progress in real time. When a fasting window ends, you can enter the end date, and the code block will show the result: whether you managed to achieve the goal, how much time you fasted beyond the plan, and so on.</p>\n<p>I'm thinking of improving the visual part a bit (currently, everything is displayed as plain text without any design).

    "text": "fastimer for obsidian 13 february 2024 · done typescript obsidian the obsidian developers recently approved one of my typescript pet plugins — fastimer . it is an intermittent fasting tracker that adds a new code block to your vault: you enter the start date of the fasting interval and get the date of its finish, the time until this moment, and a list of the zones to be passed. the block shows an up-to-date picture every time obsidian renders it, which means you can monitor your progress in real time. when a fasting window ends, you can enter the end date, and the code block will show the result: whether you managed to achieve the goal, how much time you fasted beyond the plan, and so on. i'm thinking of improving the visual part a bit (currently, everything is displayed as plain text without any design). in addition, i want to add functions for calculating statistics so that you can draw cute graphs like charts and show achievements. i already made the same in implementing the same application in python, but i’m unlikely to return to it — it’s easier to solve the task in the obsidian vault than to roll out an additional utility. in short, check out the plugin! :) you can find it by name (fastimer) in the obsidian library, or install it manually from the repository."

Eventually, some colleague (or you) will need to refer to another tabular part of the document, which is already mentioned in the method.

Well, you can write a helper method that will take the document type and the name of <strong>one</strong> table part as input. The helper will add items to the SupportedTypes map and ensure that the data already added is not lost.</p>\n<p>However, if you need a better solution, then consider doing as I wrote at the beginning of this note: split the method into auxiliary methods.

Something like:</p>\n<pre><code>Procedure AddOpeningBalancesEnteringDocument(SupportedTypes)\n\n    TabularSections = New Array;\n\n    TabularSections.Add(\"CustomerAccounts\");\n    TabularSections.Add(\"VendorAccounts\");\n    TabularSections.Add(\"PayrollDeductions\");\n\n    SupportedTypes[\"Document.Requisition\"] = StrConcat(TabularSections, \",\");\n\nEndProcedure\n</code></pre>\n<p>What do we get here? Firstly, nobody will accidentally erase the description of the document. Secondly, SonarQube will be pleased: it is highly likely to begin swearing at repeating literals with the names of tabular parts, if the helper is implemented instead of code splitting.</p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          \n        </article>\n\n",

The essence in a nutshell: a huge auto-test based on Vanessa, which is intended to check the VAT calculation, falls somewhere near the end.</p>\n<p>I start investigating. First, I look at the screenshots in Allure: OK, the reason is obvious – in one of the documents, the conditional appearance for the field with the VAT amount doesn't work. The test expected it to be unavailable if the VAT rate is zero, but it turned out to be available somehow.</p>\n<p>It's a mess, it needs to be fixed! I look at the condition in the code: well, it locks the field if the VAT rate is in the list of “zero” rates (list of VAT rates whose rate is equal to zero). Everything appears to be simple and logical. What the hell could possibly go wrong here?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EffinBirds/status/1489980393675702281\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Tweet\" src=\"https://kostyanetsky.me/notes/reuse-carefully/snap-tweet-EffinBirds-1489980393675702281.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>Well, I try to reproduce the bug manually. And there, all of a sudden, everything is nice: the conditional appearance works as it should. Floating bug, or what? I run the auto-test again, at the right moment I jump in with the debugger and find some outright garbage: in the list of “zero” rates, besides themselves, there are a bunch of empty links!</p>\n<p>Frankly speaking, I was scratching the back of my head. The document receives this list from the common module with <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/vkostyanetsky/5ec036ee148606aad9caefbc9305bfb0\" target=\"_blank\">this code</a>. An empty ref from here, even theoretically, cannot be obtained. Moreover, the module has the “Reuse Return Values” option ​​enabled, and the function is actually executes once somewhere at the beginning of the test, before all complex data manipulations. So, the test cannot affect it in any way, in theory.</p>\n<p>Is it a dead end? Well, experienced colleagues have probably already guessed everything, but I had to dance around the bug  and even check the <a href=\"https://its.1c.ru/db/v8std/content/724/hdoc\" target=\"_blank\">standard</a>, until got the following: <strong>return values ​​cache in 1C can be changed</strong>. I mean, not by calling RefreshReusableValues​​(), but by changing reusable values directly.</p>\n<p>How? Well, if you get some values ​​from a cached common module, and they are not of a primitive type (string, number, etc.), you will not get the value itself, but a pointer to it somewhere in memory. You write this pointer to a variable and try to change it – you change the cache.</p>\n<p>It's that simple, yes. This is what happened in my case: the form of another document called the method that generates the list of “zero” rates. Having received a list of values, it added an empty ref to it and used it in its logic. Thus, each time this form opens, the list cache contains more and more empty refs, which eventually broke the document at the other end of the configuration.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/EffinBirds/status/1488165946342662144\" target=\"_blank\"><img alt=\"Tweet\" src=\"https://kostyanetsky.me/notes/reuse-carefully/snap-tweet-EffinBirds-1488165946342662144.png\"/></a></p>\n<p>In a good way, the platform should throw exceptions when developer trying to change the cache, but until this happens, you have to take care yourself. For example, when developing cached modules, return immutable data types from them (FixedStructure instead of Structure, FixedArray instead of Array, and so on). True, this is not a 100% protection: firstly, fixed types are not applicable everywhere, and secondly, even in the latest versions of the SSL, this is far from being done everywhere. Do you know many configurations not based on SSL?</p>\n<p>Sonar also know nothing about the problem, as well as less popular software.
