        <p>Recently, we came up with the idea of dividing the internal ERP into several independent parts and organizing data exchange between them. We discussed the outlines of the task, the exchange model, transport, and roughly agreed on deadlines — in general, we did what we usually do.</p>
<p>I created a task for the stuff. We give them names in English, so I wrote in the first wording that came to mind.</p>
<p><img alt="Cut My Life Into Pieces" src="https://kostyanetsky.me/notes/last-resort/last-resort.png"/></p>
<p>The title came out with sound. Okay, this one is funny, but what should I call it then? Well, let it be Distributed Internal ERP. Abbreviated... DIE?</p>
<p>I let the first one be. Long live Papa Roach :)</p>

        <p>I was wasting time at the supermarket checkout: it’s evening, there aren’t many customers anymore, but the elderly cashier is clearly tired and isn’t in too much of a hurry. Standing in front a tall, gray-haired man with a luxurious beard whiles away the time studying the rack of chocolates next to the cash register.</p>
<p>Finally, he takes a Snickers, twirls it in his hands thoughtfully. Then he pushes two more towards himself and, broadly, with visible pleasure, smiles into his mustache :)</p>

        <p>Making a password recover function via SMS for our customer portal. Got to the Twilio <a href="https://support.twilio.com/hc/en-us/articles/223133767-International-support-for-Alphanumeric-Sender-ID" target="_blank">documentation</a> related to <a href="https://www.twilio.com/docs/glossary/what-alphanumeric-sender-id" target="_blank">alphanumeric sender ID</a> support in different countries; this feature allows you to send messages so that the recipient sees not the sender's number but something meaningful (a company name, for example).</p>
<p>The feature is regulated differently everywhere: in some countries it just works, but in others registration is possible or even required.</p>
<p>Well, let's take a look:</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot" src="https://kostyanetsky.me/notes/crossed/twilio.png"/></p>
<p>🤔</p>
<ul>
<li>Portugal: yes</li>
<li>Puerto Rico: no</li>
<li>Qatar: yes (with registration)</li>
<li>Reunion: yes</li>
<li>Romania: yes (with registration) (but be afraid of Dracula)</li>
</ul>
<p>I don’t know how else I can explain this cemetery.</p>
<p>UPD: Found the answer. Grave crosses mean you have to pay $700 to register.</p>
<p>To be frank, I like the explanation about Dracula much more.</p>

    <div class="f4 lh-copy black mb5 measure-wide">
        <p>I like to notice things in the world around me that clearly have a story behind them. In video games, this is called “environmental storytelling”: they don’t tell you the story directly, but if you look around, you can guess which gun was hanging on the wall and who fired from it.</p>
<p>For example, I recently celebrated the company's 10th anniversary with colleagues at a local golf club. Balls had to be sent flying from the second floor; there are no railings for obvious reasons, but a net is stretched in case someone loses their balance.</p>
<p><img alt="Photo from the club website to make it clearer." src="https://kostyanetsky.me/notes/environmental-storytelling/topgolf.jpeg"/></p>
<p>Why are you talking about this, you ask? Well, there are warnings on the walls: jump into the net of your own free will and pay <abbr title="About two hundred thousand rubles at this moment.">ten thousand dirhams</abbr>. Recording this heroic leap of faith on camera is fine as well, just prepare five thousand more.</p>
<p>Do you feel the smell of a good history? </p>
<p>Another example: once flew to Turkey to rest and decided, just in case, to look through the rules of the airline (what can be taken on board, what can not). Among the list of items prohibited from being carried on board, I found “steel spear” and “steel flail” 😬</p>
<p>UPD: Another great <a href="https://kostyanetsky.me/notes/environmental-storytelling/soundproof.jpeg" target="_blank">example</a> from somewhere on the Internet.</p>

    <div class="f4 lh-copy black mb5 measure-wide">
        <p>For the last month I have been rewriting standard data exchange between FirstBit ERP and Bitrix for a client task. Co-workers doing the same on the Bitrix side prepared a huge mapping for this case: which field on the 1C side should be transferred to which Bitrix field (and vice versa).</p>
<p>They published this mapping as Google Docs tables, in the interface of which you can see users using any document at this moment — both logged in and anonymous. Anonymous ones traditionally are displaying as <a href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/2494888?hl=en" target="_blank">animals</a>.</p>
<p>Colleagues generally prefer to work anonymously. As a result, I definetely used to feel like a Disney princess: you start working in the morning, and anonymous quokkas, penguins and chinchillas roll out from everywhere :-)</p>

        <p>Slack, of course, is a thing to scold. For being slow, for having bugs, for notifications. However, I just love his stubs in case there are no new messages.</p>

        <p>Someone told me about the Croatian comic strips <a href="http://www.to-zo.com/notbut" target="_blank">NOT/BUT</a> at the beginning of last year, when I was seriously learning to draw. Each strip there is about some kind of traumatic or simply gloomy thought that comes into the artist’s head while working. The idea is to push a reader in the right direction and give them a more practical perspective on the situation they're in.</p>
<p>I quit drawing a year later, at the end of February: it became clear that I no longer had time for a hobby. But comics are completely universal; look through, even if you have no idea what a kneaded eraser is :-)</p>

    <div class="f4 lh-copy black mb5 measure-wide">
        <p>Yesterday morning, I was buying gifts for my women. While a florist was makings bouquets for me, we had a small talk and I suddenly caught her eye. She was looking at the growing crowd of customers with calmness and a clearly readable shadow of doom. This is probably how sailors looking at a surging wave which is about to bury their boat :-)</p>
<p>People outside the flower industry grin sometimes — they say, eight of March is such a magical holiday for all the florists who make a fortune in ten hours. Well, income is really good these days, but literally anybody who has ever worked in this sphere more often associates the holiday (and a couple of days before it, by the way) with a monstrous strain on health and nerves.</p>
<p>I can say that I got off cheaply: was just deploying and servicing some IT of a local net of flower shops, nothing more (by the way, I want to proudly <a href="http://rosetta.florist/" target="_blank">recommend</a> my former colleagues!). Nonetheless, the smell of flowers caused me Vietnam syndrome for a long time :-)</p>

        <p>There is a good <a href="http://maximilyahov.ru/blog/all/mne-ok/" target="_blank">note</a> from Maxim Ilyahov about a way of analyzing something which doesn't concern you but annoys you anyway. It's reminded me of an American principle of non-judgemental attitude which I read about a couple of years ago. As for me, it uses different words to make the same point.</p>
<p>By the way, this principle presents in Russia too — there is even a famous adage “don't be judgemental so you won't be judged”. What a pity for us that it isn't so widespread yet.</p>

<p>The artist is <a href="https://www.patreon.com/adamtots" target="_blank">Adam Ellis</a>.</p>
<p>As for me, it's a great illustration for an everlasting moan “why do you always stare at your smartphone blah blah blah”. A reason is quite simple: people have their friends, books, podcasts, games, and YouTube in their smartphones. It's much more fun than a frowning man or a grim women with guru syndrome next to them, for example.</p>
<p>The same is true of children. Social networks are full of arguments about it, but a reason is still the same: if a teenager flips through pictures in his phone in front of you, you bore him and a problem obviously is you.</p>
