            <description><p class="measure-wide">The more I explore the Bitrix24 REST interface, the more I am amazed at how different its developers mindsets are.</p>
<p class="measure-wide">Let's take, for example, the interface of deals and product rows related to them. There is no amount field in the table of the products: like, you need the amount for each line – count it yourself, that's it. However, there is the amount field at the document level! Can you guess what the field is named?</p>
<p class="measure-wide">AMOUNT? DEAL_AMOUNT? DOCUMENT_AMOUNT? AMOUNT_TOTAL?</p>
<p class="measure-wide">You didn't guess, the correct answer is OPPORTUNITY.</p>
<p class="measure-wide"><img alt="What the fuck?" src="https://kostyanetsky.me/notes/strange-bitrix/what-the-fuck.jpg"/></p>
<p class="measure-wide">Where'd I digress? Yeah, a product line. It contains a product, a VAT rate, and a unit of measure. All three entities are completely independent: each has a separate table with auxiliary information and its own unique identifier. It is logical to assume that identifiers are stored in the product line: product ID, VAT rate ID, and unit ID.</p>
<p class="measure-wide">Well, yes, but no. The product field actually contains ID, but for the VAT rate field it's a rate value. What's for the unit of measure field? Well, it contains a measurement code 🤷‍♂️</p>
<p class="measure-wide">Database normalization? What? What does it mean? Get lost, bro, you're distracting us from work.</p></description>

            <description><p class="measure-wide">For the last month I have been rewriting standard data exchange between FirstBit ERP and Bitrix for a client task. Co-workers doing the same on the Bitrix side prepared a huge mapping for this case: which field on the 1C side should be transferred to which Bitrix field (and vice versa).</p>
<p class="measure-wide">They published this mapping as Google Docs tables, in the interface of which you can see users using any document at this moment — both logged in and anonymous. Anonymous ones traditionally are displaying as <a class="link blue dim bb" href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/2494888?hl=en" target="_blank">animals</a>.</p>
<p class="measure-wide">Colleagues generally prefer to work anonymously. As a result, I definetely used to feel like a Disney princess: you start working in the morning, and anonymous quokkas, penguins and chinchillas roll out from everywhere :-)</p></description>

            <description><p class="measure-wide">Slack, of course, is a thing to scold. For being slow, for having bugs, for notifications. However, I just love his stubs in case there are no new messages.</p>
<p class="measure-wide">Look at this cuteness:</p>
<p class="measure-wide"><img alt="All done. The future is yours." src="https://kostyanetsky.me/notes/slack/all-done.png"/></p>
<p class="measure-wide">Why do we need psychotherapists at all?</p>
<p class="measure-wide"><img alt="You're up to date. Go forth and do great things." src="https://kostyanetsky.me/notes/slack/up-to-date.png"/></p>
<p class="measure-wide">Or this:</p>
<p class="measure-wide"><img alt="You're all read. Here is a tractor." src="https://kostyanetsky.me/notes/slack/here-is-tractor.png"/></p>
<p class="measure-wide">Geez-Louise, Slack, hold on. You're not the first who advices this, believe me.</p></description>

            <description><p class="measure-wide">Let's speak a bit about organization of the code. If you need to describe a set of objects with common properties, think about whether this description should be divided into separate methods, each of which intended to describe one specific object?</p>
<p class="measure-wide">Let's look at this example — a method that describes tabular parts of documents suitable for some task:</p>
<pre><code>SupportedTypes["Document.SupplierPricesEntering"]   = "Prices";
SupportedTypes["Document.OpeningBalancesEntering"]  = "CustomerAccounts,VendorAccounts";
SupportedTypes["Document.Requisition"]              = "InventoryAndServices";
</code></pre>
<p class="measure-wide">Everything seems fine, right? Descriptions are there; tabular parts are listed; splitting them by comma doesn't look expensive at all.</p>
<p class="measure-wide">However, there are many documents in the method. Eventually, some colleague (or you) will need to refer to another tabular part of the document, which is already mentioned in the method. Something will distract they, they will forget to look for an existing line and something like this will turn out:</p>
<pre><code>SupportedTypes["Document.SupplierPricesEntering"]   = "Prices";
SupportedTypes["Document.OpeningBalancesEntering"]  = "CustomerAccounts,VendorAccounts";
SupportedTypes["Document.Requisition"]              = "InventoryAndServices";

&lt;...&gt;

SupportedTypes["Document.OpeningBalancesEntering"]  = "PayrollDeductions";
</code></pre>
<p class="measure-wide">As a result, a part of description will be erased, and it's good if the related functionality is covered by tests.</p>
<p class="measure-wide">Conclusion? Well, you can write a helper method that will take the document type and the name of <strong>one</strong> table part as input. The helper will add items to the SupportedTypes map and ensure that the data already added is not lost.</p>
<p class="measure-wide">However, if you need a better solution, then consider doing as I wrote at the beginning of this note: split the method into auxiliary methods. One method contains description for one document only (for all its tabular sections). Something like:</p>
<pre><code>Procedure AddOpeningBalancesEnteringDocument(SupportedTypes)

    TabularSections = New Array;

    TabularSections.Add("CustomerAccounts");
    TabularSections.Add("VendorAccounts");
    TabularSections.Add("PayrollDeductions");

    SupportedTypes["Document.Requisition"] = StrConcat(TabularSections, ",");

EndProcedure
</code></pre>
<p class="measure-wide">What do we get here? Firstly, nobody will accidentally erase the description of the document. Secondly, SonarQube will be pleased: it is highly likely to begin swearing at repeating literals with the names of tabular parts, if the helper is implemented instead of code splitting.</p></description>

            <description><p class="measure-wide">Someone told me about the Croatian comic strips <a class="link blue dim bb" href="http://www.to-zo.com/notbut" target="_blank">NOT/BUT</a> at the beginning of last year, when I was seriously learning to draw. Each strip there is about some kind of traumatic or simply gloomy thought that comes into the artist’s head while working. The idea is to push a reader in the right direction and give them a more practical perspective on the situation they're in.</p>
<p class="measure-wide">I quit drawing a year later, at the end of February: it became clear that I no longer had time for a hobby. But comics are completely universal; look through, even if you have no idea what a kneaded eraser is :-)</p>
<p class="measure-wide"><a href="http://www.to-zo.com/notbut" target="_blank"><img alt="What the actual fuck?" src="https://kostyanetsky.me/notes/not-but/mistakes.png"/></a></p>
<p class="measure-wide">All these endless soul-searching are well known to any professional, and the way out of them is not always obvious. Especially if you are angry, tired, and the deadline for the project expired somewhere last week.</p></description>

<p class="measure-wide">Oh, shoot! Just watched the video and realized that I got used to writing OK in morning statuses when asked “how do you feel today”. Like, everything is normal with me, I'm alive and doing well, nothing affects my work, etc.</p>
<p class="measure-wide">Now I'm afraid to guess what colleagues thought about me. I hope they also did not know that okay in the answer to such a question does not mean okay at all :-)</p></description>

            <description><p class="measure-wide">The other day, I was working with cookies in one of my scripts. While searching for the optimal solution, I came across an absolutely charming (100% working, by the way) <a class="link blue dim bb" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13030095/how-to-save-requests-python-cookies-to-a-file" target="_blank">tip</a> from StackOverflow:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide">You can get a CookieJar object from the session with session.cookies, and use pickle to store it to a file.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide">So, literally: keep your cookies in a jar, and to store them, pickle them. The jar with pickled cookies, by the way, can be put on the shelf later.</p>
<p class="measure-wide">How can you not love python after that, huh?</p>
<p class="measure-wide">P.S. While writing this post, I got curious – why pickle and not serialization? So, briefly: <a class="link blue dim bb" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27324986/pickles-why-are-they-called-that/27325007#27325007" target="_blank">this is the way</a>.</p></description>

<blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide">In Hokkaido, a cameraman filmed a deer with the head of another, defeated in battle, stuck in its antlers. So he walks like this all his life and pierces into dead eyes.</p>
<p class="measure-wide">The best allegory of war and the post-war time that I have come across.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide">The further it goes, the more difficult it becomes to write notes. Even as irregularly as I used to do it. Programming? Household stuff? Anything else? Whatever I decide to write about, everything ends up seeming stupid, unnecessary, and inappropriate.</p>
<p class="measure-wide">However, many topics that were previously taken seriously, but not really close — now literally acquired form, sound, taste, and color. For example, the tweet at the beginning of this note: before current events it was sad and gloomy, but now, when it's time to look into those eyes, it feels entirely different.</p>
<p class="measure-wide">Peace for everyone.</p></description>

            <title>No More Embedded Tweets</title>
            <link>https://kostyanetsky.me/notes/no-more-embedded-tweets/</link>

            <description><p class="measure-wide">As soon as I <a class="link blue dim bb" href="https://kostyanetsky.me/notes/no-more-google-fonts/" target="_blank">removed</a> Google Fonts from my blog, I had to remove embedded tweets as well.</p>
<p class="measure-wide">How did it work before? I want to link a tweet — I simply insert the link to it. The build script replaces it with an HTML block, then Twitter founds this block and replaces it with the text of the tweet (and some useful links as well). This <a class="link blue dim bb" href="https://github.com/vkostyanetsky/BlogBuilder/commit/c21ef8a7bec10672406e6be57b8e734ba3ac01c5" target="_blank">commit</a> shows you how it worked.</p>
<p class="measure-wide">How does it work now? You're right, it does not! Twitter is blocked in Russia, so its javascript works with VPN enabled only.</p>
<p class="measure-wide"><img alt="Well" src="https://kostyanetsky.me/notes/no-more-embedded-tweets/well.jpg"/></p>
<p class="measure-wide">The solution: I had to screen all the tweets that I once referred to and add them to the notes in the form of pictures with links. Whoever needs the original will turn on VPN and go to Twitter, and the rest, at least, can read the text.</p>
<p class="measure-wide">A few words about the technical side. I was too lazy to screen each tweet manually, so I was thinking about how to automate the process. At first, I came across only services that were ready to solve the problem for some pathetic ten dollars (thanks guys, maybe, one day…), but then I came across the perfect <a class="link blue dim bb" href="https://github.com/privatenumber/snap-tweet" target="_blank">tool</a>: a console script for Node.js.</p>
<p class="measure-wide">Nothing that you don't need. Pure functionality. You give a tweet to it. It gives you a picture back:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide">npx snap-tweet https://twitter.com/PossumEveryHour/status/1506148678461014016</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide">That's all. I want to donate the author, really.</p>
<p class="measure-wide">I thought about attaching snap-tweet to my build script (so that it would be like before: I insert a link to a tweet, and then it generates a picture by itself and puts it where it needs to be). Decided that I'm not gonna do it. Rude violation of KISS, and indeed… There's enough entropy in the world so far. Especially now.</p></description>

The callback is EditPrepaymentOffsetEnd method, defined in the same module; pass it the AdditionalParameters structure. The form needs to be opened so that it locks the whole interface.</p>
<p class="measure-wide">However, if the type of operation is a return to the supplier, then open the general form AdvancesPickFormWithVAT with the parameters defined in the PickParameters structure. The callback is the EditPrepaymentOffsetEnd method, defined in the same module; pass it the AdditionalParameters structure. The form needs to be opened so that it locks the whole interface.</p>
