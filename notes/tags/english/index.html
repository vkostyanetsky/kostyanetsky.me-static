    <div class="f4 lh-copy black mb5">
        <p class="measure-wide">Cambridge just sent me results of my FCE exam in June and — dramatic drum roll — I passed it! According to the statement of results, I made a bunch of mistakes in writing tasks but particularly took it out during a Speaking test. It's a pity that examiners don't give comments and reasons so it's hard to estimate the results properly; however, it's quite clear what to do next :) My English teacher said that Cambridge used to provide an overall score only earlier and it sounded like “take it any way you want, dear pretenders”.</p>
<p class="measure-wide">Well, I guess I should begin my preparation for CAE in the next year.</p>
<p class="measure-wide">Speaking about languages, I remembered Feynman with his famous “Surely You're Joking”. Among many things, he told that he learned to play on a frigideira when he lived in Brazil and had reached so high level of skill that he served as a model for local musicians.</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide">My theory is that it's like a person who speaks French who comes to America. At first they're making all kinds of mistakes, and you can hardly understand them. Then they keep on practicing until they speak rather well, and you find there's a delightful twist to their way of speaking their accent is rather nice, and you love to listen to it.</p>
<p class="measure-wide"><em>― Richard Feynman, ”Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide">As for me, there is a lot of efforts between “all kinds of mistakes” and “love to listen”, but it is such a good synopsis. Working on it!</p>

    <div class="f4 lh-copy black mb5">
        <p class="measure-wide">I was trying to understand how to transliterate my surname properly yesterday. Ministry of Foreign Affairs says it should be written as “Kostianetskii” in English — with double “i” at the end. It's the quite rare combination: “skiing” is the only frequency word that I'm able to remember.</p>
<p class="measure-wide">It caused my curiosity and I googled it. The possible reason I came across is funny: cursive writing! Double “i” looks well only on a computer screen but it suddenly turns into “u” when you try to write it on paper.</p>
<p class="measure-wide">More details are <a class="link blue dim bb" href="https://spellingisnotcrazy.weebly.com/blog/category/the-letter-i" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

    <div class="f4 lh-copy black mb5">
        <p class="measure-wide">I have <a class="link blue dim bb" href="https://acomics.ru/~sebby-x-player" target="_blank">translated</a> Stardew Valley fan manga on a wave of enthusiasm at the end of July (SV is an enormously addictive farmer simulator which <a class="link blue dim bb" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/413150/Stardew_Valley/" target="_blank">went out</a> a couple of years ago).</p>
<p class="measure-wide">It was an amusing experience. Firstly, an author of the manga is Chinese and her work was already translated from Chinese to English. I'm not sure what was the bigger problem — cultural differences or language skills, but several frames were a bit difficult to understand what's going on. Secondly, I've figured out that it's a real challenge to pick proper Russian words and not to get something like a quote from an official government's letter in the end.</p>
<p class="measure-wide">So, a part of sense had lost during the process, I guess, although I tried to keep everything I could and even had a word with the author in order to solve the most problematic cases. It was quite funny — I don't know Chinese, she doesn't know Russian, so our a bit poor English was the only way to understand each other.</p>
<p class="measure-wide">Something could have been translated better, I suppose, and several pictures definitely could have been changed more accurately. But you know what? Hell it out, perfection is a cruel mistress and I like the result yet. Yeah, there is no big deal or something like it — a drawing style is quite common, a plot has no significant differences with the game, but… I don't know. Perhaps, visual novels made a too sentimental son of a bitch out of me :-)</p>
<p class="measure-wide">Thanks to <a class="link blue dim bb" href="https://vk.com/id54890849" target="_blank">Alice</a> for helping me with image processing, <a class="link blue dim bb" href="https://twitter.com/amish77kin" target="_blank">Lem</a> for helping me with the translation and <a class="link blue dim bb" href="https://vk.com/mahrunteka" target="_blank">Marika</a> for the inspiration. And, sure, thanks to <a class="link blue dim bb" href="https://curayukie.deviantart.com" target="_blank">Quantus</a> for the manga.</p>
