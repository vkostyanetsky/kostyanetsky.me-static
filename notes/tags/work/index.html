    <div class="f4 lh-copy black mb5 measure-wide">
        <p>Looks like we finally caught our first lab-reproducible case of platform cache corruption. Short synopsis:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spin up a fresh app from the v35 template of <a href="https://firstbit.ae" target="_blank">our ERP</a>.</li>
<li>Run it and wait for initialization to finish.</li>
<li>Swap the app configuration to the v36 release (specifically build 28537 from the dev repo) and run it again.</li>
</ul>
<p>After this super simple sequence, about half the team sees the platform suddenly lose one of the enums. And it's annoyingly selective: hit an enum value on the client — all good; do the same on the server — boom, exception.</p>
<p>Same story with the manager module of one catalog: its methods exist and are exported, but after the update the platform pretends they don't and throw an exception when you call them.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/EffinBirds/status/1970264357427704080" target="_blank"><img alt="Welcome To Dipshit Central" src="https://kostyanetsky.me/notes/voodoo/welcome.jpg"/></a></p>
<p>As always, when the magic blooms — look at the cache. Clear it and symptoms vanish. There are indirect hints too:</p>
<ul>
<li>The enum did exist in v35, but it was renamed in v36.</li>
<li>Those manager-module methods didn't exist in v35 (they were added in v36).</li>
</ul>
<p>So the v35 cache didn't contain either of these in their v36 identities, yet for some reason the platform insists on digging into that old cache.</p>
<p>We still don't have a clean root cause. We traced it to a specific commit after which the bug started showing up, but the only weird thing there its <a href="https://kostyanetsky.me/notes/voodoo/the-commit.png" target="_blank">its name</a> (and honestly, there are nearby commits that look even <a href="https://kostyanetsky.me/notes/voodoo/the-other-commit.png" target="_blank">more suspicious</a> from this point of view). The rest were <a href="https://kostyanetsky.me/notes/voodoo/5ba6ac0956e0cc7bc6b520e5110420e6950478fe.diff" target="_blank">minor changes</a> that regenerate internal metadata IDs in the manifest. Yes, those IDs are tied to cache keys, but they get bumped on any metadata change and have never caused issues before.</p>
<p>If you landed here from Google because you hit the same mess — make a no-op change to the problematic object so the platform refreshes the metadata IDs in the manifest. For example, add an empty method or even just a space in the module. That fixes the configuration so the recipe at the top stops corrupting the cache.</p>
<p>Voodoo, sure — but hey, it works ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>

    <div class="f4 lh-copy black mb5 measure-wide">
        <p>A colleague noticed that on one of our Fresh instances, deleting data areas had become painfully slow. Dug into the metrics:</p>
<pre>
DELETE FROM T1
FROM _DataHistoryMetadata T1
WHERE 
    T1._MetadataId = ?
    AND T1._IsActual = 0x00 
    AND NOT (
        T1._MetadataVersionNumber IN (
            SELECT T2._MetadataVersionNumber AS MetadataVersionNumber_
            FROM _DataHistoryVersions T2
            WHERE T2._HistoryDataId IN (
                SELECT DataHistoryLatestVersions1.DataHistoryLatestVersions._HistoryDataId AS HistoryDataId_
                FROM DataHistoryLatestVersions1.DataHistoryLatestVersions T3
                WHERE DataHistoryLatestVersions1.DataHistoryLatestVersions._MetadataId = ?
            )
        )
    )
</pre>
<p>Each of these queries was reading around 20GB. What's happening is mostly clear: the platform is trying to delete an area's data history, but the janky DB query causes a full scan over the whole history table across all areas instead of using an index. Someone on Dmitrovskaya got lazy again.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/EffinBirds/status/1945545263407301033" target="_blank"><img alt="Why are you surpised?" src="https://kostyanetsky.me/notes/data-history-missing-indexes/why.png"/></a></p>
<p>So we were losing between 30 seconds and a half an hour per operation. Wanted it faster. Fix:</p>
<pre>
CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IX_DataHistoryLatestVersions1_MetadataId
  ON dbo._DataHistoryLatestVersions1 (_MetadataId)
  INCLUDE (_HistoryDataId)
  WITH (DROP_EXISTING = OFF, ONLINE = OFF);

CREATE NONCLUSTERED INDEX IX_DataHistoryVersions_MetadataVersionNumber
  ON dbo._DataHistoryVersions (_MetadataVersionNumber)
  WITH (DROP_EXISTING = OFF, ONLINE = OFF);
</pre>
<p>Deletion cost predictably dropped ~99%.</p>
<p>If you're going to repeat this on your side:</p>
<ol>
<li>Technically this violates the license agreement, you've been warned and all that.</li>
<li>There's a risk the platform will trip over the new indexes during future restructurings (especially on the "new" schema). Better to have a ready script to drop the index, and then (after restructuring) put it back.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is the message the current platform throws up when you try to connect to an offline server cluster. I do appreciate minimalism in interfaces, of course, but this is definitely over the top.</p>
<p>What's more, the platform is installed with only a single language pack (English) and even launched with a hard override to "Ven VLen", yet somehow the native birches still manage to sprout up. Maybe the C++ library that fires off the message (DataExchangeTcpClientImpl.cpp) is looking at the OS language (Russian) in my case — hard to say.</p>
<p>Anyway, I can't shake the Bugs Bunny vibes every time I see that dialog box.</p>

<p>A couple of Easter eggs hidden inside FirstBit ERP. They're tucked away for the developers: in the first case, users see just the form title and notification text, while in the second, they see the standard "waiting for connection" message.</p>
<p>I like to add little things like this from time to time — it helps to keep things fun, even when the task isn’t the most exciting or I’m just feeling tired. If you haven’t checked out Bystronovsky’s "<a href="https://collab.ldwg.ru/stressless-design" target="_blank">Design Without Stress</a>", you really should — no way I could explain it better myself.</p>
<p>By the way, here’s another Easter egg! Not from our ERP this time, but from a new tool we’re making for automated database updates. We're building it just for ourselves, so we can joke around with the user a bit :)</p>

<p>Our lead developer recently shared some insights about our work — specifically, developing ERP systems on 1C for the UAE and, more recently, Saudi Arabia. The session was hosted by the online English school Across, so the audience was spot-on: Russian-speaking folks interested in building careers and exploring international markets.</p>
<p>Overall, it turned out pretty cool, especially as a language practice. Just a reminder: learning foreign languages is still one of the best ways to give your brain a workout, and it’s also super accessible. There’s no shortage of resources, communities, and interest-based clubs out there — you just need the motivation :)</p>

            <h2 class="f2 lh-title"><a class="link blue bb dim" href="https://kostyanetsky.me/notes/tags/work/bit-of-surgery/">A Little Bit Of Surgery</a></h2>

            
    
    <div class="f4 lh-copy black mb5 measure-wide">
        <p>A few years ago, I stumbled upon a story about a programmer who had to debug software controlling a surgical robot — right in the middle of an operation. That blew my mind, to be frank.</p>
<p>Today, my colleague and I were fixing a 1C cluster with databases running on 1cFresh. After migrating it to a neighboring server, the thing suddenly started acting up. Long story short: trying to print a document would send the client app into its death throes.  </p>
<p>While we were knee-deep in troubleshooting, I had this thought: sure, it doesn’t look as terrifying as debugging software that someone’s life literally depends on. But if you think about all the clients sitting on edge because their business is grinding to a halt... Well, who knows where the stress levels are higher?  </p>
<p><strong>P.S. Nerdy details for the curious.</strong> During the migration, the permissions for the server cache folder didn’t transfer properly. This led to a funny (well, not so funny) effect: the logs would happily land there, but session data wouldn’t.  </p>
<p>So, when someone opened a print form, the configuration tried saving it to the storage, and rphost, in turn, attempted to shove it into the session cache. Here’s where things went sideways: the worker' process (probably) got slapped on the wrist by the OS. Due to (apparently) some funky file system event handling in the platform, the exception wasn’t caught, so the poor thing had no better idea than to kill the session. Naturally, this caused the client process to crash.  </p>
<p>We fixed the permissions, rebooted the cluster, and voilà! The problem was gone.  </p>
<p><img alt="End of Report" src="https://kostyanetsky.me/notes/bit-of-surgery/report.jpeg"/></p>
<p>All other hypotheses — cluster manager acting up, lack of hardware resources, configuration bugs, client-side issues, broken security profiles, network problems between the client and server — got tossed out during the diagnostics process.</p>

    <div class="f4 lh-copy black mb5 measure-wide">
        <p>I found a <a href="https://gist.github.com/vkostyanetsky/b0807f2df2501bbeeb97c95a977f3e23" target="_blank">script</a> that I wrote a couple of years ago for our work GitLab. In short, we run our development repository through a barrage of tests on Vanessa daily, resulting in a nice report showing how many tests passed, which ones failed, the reasons for failures, and so on.</p>
<p>The report needs to be analyzed regularly, at least at a glance. Of course, we haven’t seen fully "green" tests in a long time, and that’s expected: for example, in the case of interdependent development, commits can break the checked functionality, and the tests still need adjustments. However, keeping a pulse on it is still essential.</p>
<p>To simplify this routine, I expanded the pipeline code a bit: after generating the report, GitLab first creates a brief summary (client type, database type, test statistics) and sends it to Slack.</p>
<p><img alt="Report" src="https://kostyanetsky.me/notes/slack-summary/report.jpg"/></p>
<p>As a bonus, it’s now easier to answer the philosophical question, "who broke everything". Most often, it’s the author of the first commit on which the Scenarios Failed metric in the screenshot above hit the ceiling :)</p>

    <div class="f4 lh-copy black mb5 measure-wide">
        <p>I get a complaint: a client can’t log into our customer portal. I check the database — the account is fine. So what’s the problem? I check the login and see a strange sight:</p>
<p><img alt="PDF" src="https://kostyanetsky.me/notes/pdf/pdf.png"/></p>
<p>Above is what the user entered, and below is what’s in the database. My first thought: how on earth did a document end up in the string? :D</p>
<p>I’ll skip the further investigation. The key here is asking the right questions (otherwise, both Google and AI will be thinking about the popular file format, not the symbol). So, PDF in the context of Unicode means Pop Directional Formatting! It’s a symbol that controls text direction; it’s needed, for example, to properly render Arabic (which can contain both left-to-right and right-to-left text). The user obviously enters the login in RTL mode (or copies it from somewhere), and the portal does not understand this nuance.</p>
<p>In short, a piece of cake. However, I’d like to point out that the PDF file format existed long before the PDF symbol. I get that these are different technical fields, and the developers probably didn’t see the overlapping terminology as a significant issue. But deep down, I’m sure someone was smirking, anticipating today’s confusion.</p>

<p>I'm currently looking at the <a href="https://www.sama.gov.sa/en-US/FinExc/Pages/Currency.aspx" target="_blank">website</a> of their central bank. The country's currency is the Saudi riyal, and the Central Bank sets rates for other currencies in relation to it. Consequently, there is no point in asking the bank for the rate of the riyal itself. However, the website calmly suggests choosing it twice:</p>
<p><img alt="The selection form" src="https://kostyanetsky.me/notes/singapore-doll/cb.png"/></p>
<p>For your information, the first option breaks the website, and the second one pedantically displays “1” for any date.</p>
<p>Another funny thing: colleagues seem to store currency names as 14-character strings. Otherwise, it is difficult to explain why, according to their data, Canada uses not the Canadian dollar but CANADIAN DOLLA, and Romania uses mysterious NEW ROMANIAN L instead of its leu. However, these two are rather lucky: Singapore, for example, conducts payments in SINGAPORE DOLL.</p>

        <p>Recently, we came up with the idea of dividing the internal ERP into several independent parts and organizing data exchange between them. We discussed the outlines of the task, the exchange model, transport, and roughly agreed on deadlines — in general, we did what we usually do.</p>
<p>I created a task for the stuff. We give them names in English, so I wrote in the first wording that came to mind.</p>

    <div class="f4 lh-copy black mb5 measure-wide">
        <p>Among our projects, we have one where two systems are communicating with each other: ERP and CRM. Data exchange is done well: a push'n'pull server has been set up, subscriptions to events have been registered, a REST API has been implemented, and so on. There are many other fascinating technical details, but I'm not talking about that now.</p>
<p>The exchange has various logic chains inside. For instance, if a new company appears in CRM, it sends the data to ERP. The other day, a problem appeared: a company was not sent from the CRM, no matter how many times you tried to write it. So we went to investigate, suspecting the worst: CRM is written in PHP (nothing personal; it’s just not our technical stack), and there’s a lot of different legacy stuff there. It's easier to shoot yourself in the foot than to blow your nose.</p>
<p>However, it didn't take much digging. We opened the company’s page in CRM and saw that he had the “Do Not Export To ERP” checkbox, which, in fact, blocked the sending. A manager made an obvious mistake.</p>
<p>Should we uncheck the box and close the ticket?</p>
<p><img alt="Well yes, but actually no" src="https://kostyanetsky.me/notes/do-not/actually.jpg"/></p>
<p>This will solve the problem with that particular company, but not the reason it appeared. It is actually in the interface, specifically in the name of the option: “do not” is used, which is advisable to avoid due to the fact that it is more difficult for users to read the wording correctly. By the way, this also applies to a simple “do”.</p>
<p>It is often difficult for programmers to understand why this is so: we are used to instantly calculating Boolean expressions in our heads, and variations like “not (not true)” are commonplace for us. But people with a different background can get confused. Just a little, but sometimes this is enough for them to perceive “do not export” as “do export” in the heat of the day, click the option, and move on.</p>
<p>To sum up, the solution is to rename the checkbox. “Disable Export” or “Stop Export” are both fine, for example. “Prohibit Export” also comes to mind, but it’s more about interpersonal relationships, and in general, a ban on doing something does not mean that it won’t be done :)</p>

        <p>Some time ago, I was setting up <a href="https://swagger.io" target="_blank">Swagger</a> for the internal API. While I was fiddling around, it became clear that some functionality did not need to be included in the documentation. I was looking for a way to do this without crutches and came across a funny <a href="https://github.com/tiangolo/full-stack-fastapi-couchbase/issues/10" target="_blank">question</a> on GitHub.</p>
<p>What's funny, you ask? Well, I involuntarily remembered <a href="https://forum.mista.ru" target="_blank">Mista</a>. Among 1C developers, this is synonymous with the word “toxicity”: if you ask anything there, you get a bucket of slop by the collar instead of an answer. Here, of course, everything is not so neglected, but holy crap! These persistent guys who referring to the 14-page manual made me laugh a lot.</p>
<p>One thing is good: by the end of the thread, there appeared a brave rebel who just answered the question. They, like, named the required parameter for a FastAPI method's decorator, which is not supposed to be shown in the documentation. No links — could you imagine?</p>
<p>Not all heroes wear capes, I would say.</p>

    <div class="f4 lh-copy black mb5 measure-wide">
        <p>I like to notice things in the world around me that clearly have a story behind them. In video games, this is called “environmental storytelling”: they don’t tell you the story directly, but if you look around, you can guess which gun was hanging on the wall and who fired from it.</p>
<p>For example, I recently celebrated the company's 10th anniversary with colleagues at a local golf club. Balls had to be sent flying from the second floor; there are no railings for obvious reasons, but a net is stretched in case someone loses their balance.</p>
<p><img alt="Photo from the club website to make it clearer." src="https://kostyanetsky.me/notes/environmental-storytelling/topgolf.jpeg"/></p>
<p>Why are you talking about this, you ask? Well, there are warnings on the walls: jump into the net of your own free will and pay <abbr title="About two hundred thousand rubles at this moment.">ten thousand dirhams</abbr>. Recording this heroic leap of faith on camera is fine as well, just prepare five thousand more.</p>
<p>Do you feel the smell of a good history? </p>
<p>Another example: once flew to Turkey to rest and decided, just in case, to look through the rules of the airline (what can be taken on board, what can not). Among the list of items prohibited from being carried on board, I found “steel spear” and “steel flail” 😬</p>

    <div class="f4 lh-copy black mb5 measure-wide">
        <p>This week, I developed a REST service to set up our service manager (this is a configuration for managing a 1cFresh instance). Deploying the development environment is a regular task for us, and every time the manager's database had to be tuned by hand: tweaking the storefront, changing application addresses, overwriting scheduled tasks, and so on.</p>
<p>The implementation was simple. Come up with a JSON structure, write a parser, find a code in the configuration, make it work by external call, and make sure you don't break anything. Routine work, in general, but I love to do such things from time to time: I mean, to look around and try to figure out which of the daily tasks is annoying enough.</p>
<p>This one is a good example. To be frank, setting up the Service Manager wasn't a problem (launching the app and fiddling with the settings), but it was a thing to pay attention &amp; spend time to. What do we have now:</p>
<ol>
<li>There is a JSON file with all the settings;</li>
<li>There is a REST service for its processing;</li>
<li>There is a script that will put the first into the second;</li>
<li>There is a pipeline that will do it all by itself.</li>
</ol>

    <div class="f4 lh-copy black mb5 measure-wide">
        <p>The more I explore the Bitrix24 REST interface, the more I am amazed at how different its developers mindsets are. It is expressed in different ways.</p>
<p>Let's take, for example, the interface of deals and product rows related to them. There is no amount field in the table of the products: like, you need the amount for each line – count it yourself, that's it. However, there is the amount field at the document level! Can you guess what the field is named?</p>
<p>AMOUNT? DEAL_AMOUNT? DOCUMENT_AMOUNT? AMOUNT_TOTAL?</p>
<p>You didn't guess, the correct answer is OPPORTUNITY.</p>
<p><img alt="What the fuck?" src="https://kostyanetsky.me/notes/strange-bitrix/what-the-fuck.jpg"/></p>
<p>Where'd I digress? Yeah, a product line. It contains a product, a VAT rate, and a unit of measure. All three entities are completely independent: each has a separate table with auxiliary information and its own unique identifier. It is logical to assume that identifiers are stored in the product line: product ID, VAT rate ID, and unit ID.</p>
<p>Well, yes, but no. The product field actually contains ID, but for the VAT rate field it's a rate value. What's for the unit of measure field? Well, it contains a measurement code ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
<p>Database normalization? What? What does it mean? Back off, man, you're distracting us from work.</p>

        <p>Someone told me about the Croatian comic strips <a href="http://www.to-zo.com/notbut" target="_blank">NOT/BUT</a> at the beginning of last year, when I was seriously learning to draw. Each strip there is about some kind of traumatic or simply gloomy thought that comes into the artist’s head while working. The idea is to push a reader in the right direction and give them a more practical perspective on the situation they're in.</p>
<p>I quit drawing a year later, at the end of February: it became clear that I no longer had time for a hobby. But comics are completely universal; look through, even if you have no idea what a kneaded eraser is :-)</p>

<p>All these endless soul-searching are well known to any professional, and the way out of them is not always obvious. Especially if you are angry, tired, and the deadline for the project expired somewhere last week.</p>
