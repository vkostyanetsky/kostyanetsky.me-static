    <div class="f4 lh-copy black mb5 measure-wide">
        <p>Recently, I was working with vocabulary in an attempt to describe my latest adventures to an English-speaking friend and got to know about the colorful idiom “to go postal”. It means something like “go crazy with anger”; appeared somewhere between the 80s and 90s in the USA after a series of rather <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Going_postal" target="_blank">insane incidents</a> in which postal workers went crazy and attacked people around, including colleagues and visitors.</p>
<p>The expression sounds funny at first glance, but the story behind the scenes is painfully gloomy. I think I will continue to use the good old “to go ballistic”. Literally, “get angry that strong so you become a rocket which lost control”. Or, to simplify, “explode with anger”.</p>
<p>By the way, there are similar rocket-like connotations in Russian, but for some reason they are about a more manageable cases. Mostly, they implies something like "the fire in the ass was so damn strong that the poor guy left Earth and successfully landed on Mars". Sounds a bit better than a simple explosion — you didn't completely waste the precious resource, at least :-)</p>

    <div class="f4 lh-copy black mb5 measure-wide">
        <blockquote>
<p>An important detail: the CallPause method is not available in a client-server call; when a client calls a server method in which CallPause is called, the exception "Cannot call the CallPause method in a client-server call" will be thrown.</p>
<p><a href="https://wonderland.v8.1c.ru/blog/metod-vyzvatpauzu/" target="_blank">CallPause Method</a> (RU)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What a strange restriction, to be frank. On the one hand, an experienced developer will not make an intentional pause in a client-server call anyway; on the other hand, whoever wants to make it makes it anyway (by checking time in a cycle, for example). Does security by obscurity worth the efforts?</p>
<p>At best, some junior will catch this exception, think “welp, it looks like I'm doing something wrong” and move in the right direction. However, putting the restriction on the platform for the sake of this case is like firing a cannon at sparrows. You know what? Let's implement a number limit as well — like, no more than 1000 pauses per session, otherwise users will suddenly think that the program is too slow :-)</p>

        <p>The daily award for the most philosophical code goes to the author of this elegant way to check that two boolean variables are not equal to each other:</p>
<pre><code>If DataStructure.Property("AmountVATIn")
    And ((DataStructure.AmountVATIn And NOT SearchPriceIncludesVAT)
    OR (NOT DataStructure.AmountVATIn And SearchPriceIncludesVAT)) Then    
    Price = RecalculateAmountOnVATFlagsChange(Price, DataStructure.AmountVATIn, TabSectionLine.VATRate);
EndIf;
</code></pre>
<p>I'm thinking of adding something like “And Not (DataStructure.AmountVATIn = SearchPriceIncludesVAT)” here to spice it up with a subtle note of insanity.</p>

    <div class="f4 lh-copy black mb5 measure-wide">
        <p>I like to notice things in the world around me that clearly have a story behind them. In video games, this is called “environmental storytelling”: they don’t tell you the story directly, but if you look around, you can guess which gun was hanging on the wall and who fired from it.</p>
<p>For example, I recently celebrated the company's 10th anniversary with colleagues at a local golf club. Balls had to be sent flying from the second floor; there are no railings for obvious reasons, but a net is stretched in case someone loses their balance.</p>
<p><img alt="Photo from the club website to make it clearer." src="https://kostyanetsky.me/notes/environmental-storytelling/topgolf.jpeg"/></p>
<p>Why are you talking about this, you ask? Well, there are warnings on the walls: jump into the net of your own free will and pay <abbr title="About two hundred thousand rubles at this moment.">ten thousand dirhams</abbr>. Recording this heroic leap of faith on camera is fine as well, just prepare five thousand more.</p>
<p>Do you feel the smell of a good history? </p>
<p>Another example: once flew to Turkey to rest and decided, just in case, to look through the rules of the airline (what can be taken on board, what can not). Among the list of items prohibited from being carried on board, I found “steel spear” and “steel flail” 😬</p>
<p>UPD: Another great <a href="https://kostyanetsky.me/notes/environmental-storytelling/soundproof.jpeg" target="_blank">example</a> from somewhere on the Internet.</p>

            <h2 class="f2 lh-title"><a class="link blue bb dim" href="https://kostyanetsky.me/notes/outgoing-requests-limiter/">Slow down, I'm recording</a></h2>

            
    
    <div class="f4 lh-copy black mb5 measure-wide">
        <p>Usually the idea of developing is simple: the faster it works, the better. For example, the more requests an application manages to execute per unit of time, the faster the task for which these requests are needed will be solved.</p>
<p>However, it also happens the other way around: you need to reduce the number of operations that a program is able to perform. Let's imagine we exchange data with an external service and it bans if we hit it with requests too often. For example: the cloud version of <a href="https://bitrix24.net" target="_blank">Bitrix24</a> requires sending requests to it no more than two per second.</p>
<p>Here is an <a href="https://github.com/vkostyanetsky/OutgoingRequestsLimiter" target="_blank">implementation</a> of such a slowdown, which I wrote last week. There is no queue support; the main solved problem is to execute as many requests as possible without going beyond the limit (taking into account the fact that requests can be made from different sessions).</p>
<p>The problem is solved through a constant that stores the date for the current second and the number of requests that have already been sent. Clients who run into a limitation are waiting. This approach is not suitable for high-loaded systems, but otherwise it can come in handy.</p>

    <div class="f4 lh-copy black mb5 measure-wide">
        <p>This week, I developed a REST service to set up our service manager (this is a configuration for managing a 1cFresh instance). Deploying the development environment is a regular task for us, and every time the manager's database had to be tuned by hand: tweaking the storefront, changing application addresses, overwriting scheduled tasks, and so on.</p>
<p>The implementation was simple. Come up with a JSON structure, write a parser, find a code in the configuration, make it work by external call, and make sure you don't break anything. Routine work, in general, but I love to do such things from time to time: I mean, to look around and try to figure out which of the daily tasks is annoying enough.</p>
<p>This one is a good example. To be frank, setting up the Service Manager wasn't a problem (launching the app and fiddling with the settings), but it was a thing to pay attention &amp; spend time to. What do we have now:</p>
<ol>
<li>There is a JSON file with all the settings;</li>
<li>There is a REST service for its processing;</li>
<li>There is a script that will put the first into the second;</li>
<li>There is a pipeline that will do it all by itself.</li>
</ol>
<p>In short, a boot was rubbing a leg, and now it isn't. Yahoo!</p>

<p>The colleague grumbled that if you think like that, then the configurator will be Zhiguli, and the EDT will be Kama1 (this is an electric car that has been developed somewhere in the depths of KAMAZ for many years and still can’t gather strength and, finally, show the wonder to the world).</p>
<p>Well, I try to look at things with optimism. I think the platform and its IDE are such haul trucks. No one in their right mind rides them on household chores, but these beasts are irreplaceable on a cut!</p>

    <div class="f4 lh-copy black mb5 measure-wide">
        <p>The more I explore the Bitrix24 REST interface, the more I am amazed at how different its developers mindsets are. It is expressed in different ways.</p>
<p>Let's take, for example, the interface of deals and product rows related to them. There is no amount field in the table of the products: like, you need the amount for each line – count it yourself, that's it. However, there is the amount field at the document level! Can you guess what the field is named?</p>
<p>AMOUNT? DEAL_AMOUNT? DOCUMENT_AMOUNT? AMOUNT_TOTAL?</p>
<p>You didn't guess, the correct answer is OPPORTUNITY.</p>
<p><img alt="What the fuck?" src="https://kostyanetsky.me/notes/strange-bitrix/what-the-fuck.jpg"/></p>
<p>Where'd I digress? Yeah, a product line. It contains a product, a VAT rate, and a unit of measure. All three entities are completely independent: each has a separate table with auxiliary information and its own unique identifier. It is logical to assume that identifiers are stored in the product line: product ID, VAT rate ID, and unit ID.</p>
<p>Well, yes, but no. The product field actually contains ID, but for the VAT rate field it's a rate value. What's for the unit of measure field? Well, it contains a measurement code ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
<p>Database normalization? What? What does it mean? Back off, man, you're distracting us from work.</p>

        <p>For the last month I have been rewriting standard data exchange between FirstBit ERP and Bitrix for a client task. Co-workers doing the same on the Bitrix side prepared a huge mapping for this case: which field on the 1C side should be transferred to which Bitrix field (and vice versa).</p>
<p>They published this mapping as Google Docs tables, in the interface of which you can see users using any document at this moment — both logged in and anonymous. Anonymous ones traditionally are displaying as <a href="https://support.google.com/docs/answer/2494888?hl=en" target="_blank">animals</a>.</p>
<p>Colleagues generally prefer to work anonymously. As a result, I definetely used to feel like a Disney princess: you start working in the morning, and anonymous quokkas, penguins and chinchillas roll out from everywhere :-)</p>

        <p>Slack, of course, is a thing to scold. For being slow, for having bugs, for notifications. However, I just love his stubs in case there are no new messages.</p>
<p>Look at this cuteness:</p>
<p><img alt="All done. The future is yours." src="https://kostyanetsky.me/notes/slack/all-done.png"/></p>
<p>Why do we need psychotherapists at all?</p>

<p>Or this:</p>

    <div class="f4 lh-copy black mb5 measure-wide">
        <p>Let's speak a bit about organization of the code. If you need to describe a set of objects with common properties, think about whether this description should be divided into separate methods, each of which intended to describe one specific object?</p>
<p>Let's look at this example — a method that describes tabular parts of documents suitable for some task:</p>
<pre><code>SupportedTypes["Document.SupplierPricesEntering"]   = "Prices";
SupportedTypes["Document.OpeningBalancesEntering"]  = "CustomerAccounts,VendorAccounts";
SupportedTypes["Document.Requisition"]              = "InventoryAndServices";
</code></pre>
<p>Everything seems fine, right? Descriptions are there; tabular parts are listed; splitting them by comma doesn't look expensive at all.</p>
<p>However, there are many documents in the method. Eventually, some colleague (or you) will need to refer to another tabular part of the document, which is already mentioned in the method. Something will distract they, they will forget to look for an existing line and something like this will turn out:</p>
<pre><code>SupportedTypes["Document.SupplierPricesEntering"]   = "Prices";
SupportedTypes["Document.OpeningBalancesEntering"]  = "CustomerAccounts,VendorAccounts";
SupportedTypes["Document.Requisition"]              = "InventoryAndServices";

&lt;...&gt;

SupportedTypes["Document.OpeningBalancesEntering"]  = "PayrollDeductions";
</code></pre>
<p>As a result, a part of description will be erased, and it's good if the related functionality is covered by tests.</p>
<p>Conclusion? Well, you can write a helper method that will take the document type and the name of <strong>one</strong> table part as input. The helper will add items to the SupportedTypes map and ensure that the data already added is not lost.</p>
<p>However, if you need a better solution, then consider doing as I wrote at the beginning of this note: split the method into auxiliary methods. One method contains description for one document only (for all its tabular sections). Something like:</p>
<pre><code>Procedure AddOpeningBalancesEnteringDocument(SupportedTypes)

    TabularSections = New Array;

    TabularSections.Add("CustomerAccounts");
    TabularSections.Add("VendorAccounts");
    TabularSections.Add("PayrollDeductions");

    SupportedTypes["Document.Requisition"] = StrConcat(TabularSections, ",");

EndProcedure
</code></pre>
<p>What do we get here? Firstly, nobody will accidentally erase the description of the document. Secondly, SonarQube will be pleased: it is highly likely to begin swearing at repeating literals with the names of tabular parts, if the helper is implemented instead of code splitting.</p>

        <p>Someone told me about the Croatian comic strips <a href="http://www.to-zo.com/notbut" target="_blank">NOT/BUT</a> at the beginning of last year, when I was seriously learning to draw. Each strip there is about some kind of traumatic or simply gloomy thought that comes into the artist’s head while working. The idea is to push a reader in the right direction and give them a more practical perspective on the situation they're in.</p>
<p>I quit drawing a year later, at the end of February: it became clear that I no longer had time for a hobby. But comics are completely universal; look through, even if you have no idea what a kneaded eraser is :-)</p>

    <div class="f4 lh-copy black mb5 measure-wide">
        <p>As soon as I <a href="https://kostyanetsky.me/notes/no-more-google-fonts" target="_blank">removed</a> Google Fonts from my blog, I had to remove embedded tweets as well.</p>
<p>How did it work before? I want to link a tweet — I simply insert the link to it. The build script replaces it with an HTML block, then Twitter founds this block and replaces it with the text of the tweet (and some useful links as well). This <a href="https://github.com/vkostyanetsky/BlogBuilder/commit/c21ef8a7bec10672406e6be57b8e734ba3ac01c5" target="_blank">commit</a> shows you how it worked.</p>
<p>How does it work now? You're right, it does not! Twitter is blocked in Russia, so its javascript works with VPN enabled only.</p>
<p><img alt="Well" src="https://kostyanetsky.me/notes/no-more-embedded-tweets/well.jpg"/></p>
<p>The solution: I had to screen all the tweets that I once referred to and add them to the notes in the form of pictures with links. Whoever needs the original will turn on VPN and go to Twitter, and the rest, at least, can read the text.</p>
<p>A few words about the technical side. I was too lazy to screen each tweet manually, so I was thinking about how to automate the process. At first, I came across only services that were ready to solve the problem for some pathetic ten dollars (thanks guys, maybe, one day…), but then I came across the perfect <a href="https://github.com/privatenumber/snap-tweet" target="_blank">tool</a>: a console script for Node.js.</p>
<p>Nothing that you don't need. Pure functionality. You give a tweet to it. It gives you a picture back:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>npx snap-tweet https://twitter.com/PossumEveryHour/status/1506148678461014016</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's all. I want to donate the author, really.</p>
<p>I thought about attaching snap-tweet to my build script (so that it would be like before: I insert a link to a tweet, and then it generates a picture by itself and puts it where it needs to be). Decided that I'm not gonna do it. Rude violation of KISS, and indeed… There's enough entropy in the world so far. Especially now.</p>

<p>A year ago, damn it. Okay, hello everyone! Johnny Slowpoke is here! Today we will throw out Google Fonts from my blog. I used to load the main font (PT Sans) from this service, but it makes almost no sense without cross-domain caching. Frankly speaking, the only point to do this further is if a server on which the site is running is slow, so it is faster to load fonts from Google. </p>
<p>I host my blog on GitHub servers and have no complaints about performance. So, I'm self-hosting PT Sans now, and you know what? The difference is dramatic. When updating a page before, there was clearly a noticeable delay between loading the page and loading the font. For now, it is barely recognizable. If you have a blog and want to try to self-host fonts — here is a cool <a href="https://google-webfonts-helper.herokuapp.com/fonts" target="_blank">service</a> that solves the problem in a few clicks.</p>
<p>Don't forget to put a big, nice star on the <a href="https://github.com/majodev/google-webfonts-helper" target="_blank">repository</a>!</p>

    <div class="f4 lh-copy black mb5 measure-wide">
        <p>It is a bit late to sum up, isn't it? Well, the previous couple of months have been, um, tight, so I had no actual time  to sit down and think. Now I'm on vacation for 2021 – so no time like the present. I'm writing, like, from the past.</p>
<p>Write out each achievement doesn't attract me at all. The year definitely turned out to be good: I did a lot of complex work on FirstBit ERP (wrote new modules, rewrote existing ones, crushed bugs, wrote functional and load tests – yes, there were countless things). This had a good effect both on the configuration itself and on the profits of my company. In addition, I passed 1C expert exam and a PostgreSQL professional exam. Hip-hip-hooray.</p>
<p>There were fails as well. I still feel lazy to jot them down, but the main one is obvious – I became monstrously fat and instead of losing ten kilograms (that was the original plan) – I gained five more.</p>
<p>Looking back, the root of most of the problems over the past year is this: I focused too much on task flow. They were all interesting in their own way, from a carefully written technical task to challenges like “find a problem in the code using your witcher's instincts”. You do one task, another, a third, a hundredth, and you do not notice that you have ignored almost everything except work. As a result, you get a lot of experience, but the world dries up to the Configurator window and there is no strength to somehow apply this experience. Unhealthy bullshit.</p>
<p>In short, if you imagine me as a character in some video game, it looks like this: attack and intelligence have grown noticeably over the year, but health, agility, charisma, and almost everything else in general, have dropped. Now I need to do something to deal with this mess.</p>
<p>You know what? I'll take ten kilometers run for a start.</p>

    <div class="f4 lh-copy black mb5 measure-wide">
        <p>I'll tell you about a funny and a little embarrassing case that I took apart in January. The essence in a nutshell: a huge auto-test based on Vanessa, which is intended to check the VAT calculation, falls somewhere near the end.</p>
<p>I start investigating. First, I look at the screenshots in Allure: OK, the reason is obvious – in one of the documents, the conditional appearance for the field with the VAT amount doesn't work. The test expected it to be unavailable if the VAT rate is zero, but it turned out to be available somehow.</p>
<p>It's a mess, it needs to be fixed! I look at the condition in the code: well, it locks the field if the VAT rate is in the list of “zero” rates (list of VAT rates whose rate is equal to zero). Everything appears to be simple and logical. What the hell could possibly go wrong here?</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/EffinBirds/status/1489980393675702281" target="_blank"><img alt="Tweet" src="https://kostyanetsky.me/notes/reuse-carefully/snap-tweet-EffinBirds-1489980393675702281.png"/></a></p>
<p>Well, I try to reproduce the bug manually. And there, all of a sudden, everything is nice: the conditional appearance works as it should. Floating bug, or what? I run the auto-test again, at the right moment I jump in with the debugger and find some outright garbage: in the list of “zero” rates, besides themselves, there are a bunch of empty links!</p>
<p>Frankly speaking, I was scratching the back of my head. The document receives this list from the common module with <a href="https://gist.github.com/vkostyanetsky/5ec036ee148606aad9caefbc9305bfb0" target="_blank">this code</a>. An empty ref from here, even theoretically, cannot be obtained. Moreover, the module has the “Reuse Return Values” option ​​enabled, and the function is actually executes once somewhere at the beginning of the test, before all complex data manipulations. So, the test cannot affect it in any way, in theory.</p>
<p>Is it a dead end? Well, experienced colleagues have probably already guessed everything, but I had to dance around the bug  and even check the <a href="https://its.1c.ru/db/v8std/content/724/hdoc" target="_blank">standard</a>, until got the following: <strong>return values ​​cache in 1C can be changed</strong>. I mean, not by calling RefreshReusableValues​​(), but by changing reusable values directly.</p>
<p>How? Well, if you get some values ​​from a cached common module, and they are not of a primitive type (string, number, etc.), you will not get the value itself, but a pointer to it somewhere in memory. You write this pointer to a variable and try to change it – you change the cache.</p>
<p>It's that simple, yes. This is what happened in my case: the form of another document called the method that generates the list of “zero” rates. Having received a list of values, it added an empty ref to it and used it in its logic. Thus, each time this form opens, the list cache contains more and more empty refs, which eventually broke the document at the other end of the configuration.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/EffinBirds/status/1488165946342662144" target="_blank"><img alt="Tweet" src="https://kostyanetsky.me/notes/reuse-carefully/snap-tweet-EffinBirds-1488165946342662144.png"/></a></p>
<p>In a good way, the platform should throw exceptions when developer trying to change the cache, but until this happens, you have to take care yourself. For example, when developing cached modules, return immutable data types from them (FixedStructure instead of Structure, FixedArray instead of Array, and so on). True, this is not a 100% protection: firstly, fixed types are not applicable everywhere, and secondly, even in the latest versions of the SSL, this is far from being done everywhere. Do you know many configurations not based on SSL?</p>
<p>Sonar also know nothing about the problem, as well as less popular software. No silver bullet, in short – check your code, look at the code of your colleagues and try not to forget about another elegant way to bang ourselves in the foot.</p>
