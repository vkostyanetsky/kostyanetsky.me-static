        <p class="measure-wide">Slack, of course, is a thing to scold. For being slow, for having bugs, for notifications. But I just love his stubs in case there are no new messages.</p>
<p class="measure-wide">Look at this cuteness:</p>
<p class="measure-wide"><img alt="All done. The future is yours." src="https://kostyanetsky.me/notes/slack/all-done.png"/></p>
<p class="measure-wide">Why do we need psychotherapists at all?</p>
<p class="measure-wide"><img alt="You're up to date. Go forth and do great things." src="https://kostyanetsky.me/notes/slack/up-to-date.png"/></p>
<p class="measure-wide">Or this:</p>
<p class="measure-wide"><img alt="You're all read. Here is a tractor." src="https://kostyanetsky.me/notes/slack/here-is-tractor.png"/></p>
<p class="measure-wide">Geez-Louise, Slack, hold on. You're not the first who advices this, believe me.</p>

    <div class="f4 lh-copy black mb5">
        <p class="measure-wide">Someone told me about the Croatian comic strips <a class="link blue dim bb" href="http://www.to-zo.com/notbut" target="_blank">NOT/BUT</a> at the beginning of last year, when I was seriously learning to draw. Each strip there is about some kind of traumatic or simply gloomy thought that comes into the artist’s head while working. The idea is to push a reader in the right direction and give them a more practical perspective on the situation they're in.</p>
<p class="measure-wide">I quit drawing a year later, at the end of February: it became clear that I no longer had time for a hobby. But comics are completely universal; look through, even if you have no idea what a kneaded eraser is :-)</p>
<p class="measure-wide"><a href="http://www.to-zo.com/notbut" target="_blank"><img alt="What the actual fuck?" src="https://kostyanetsky.me/notes/not-but/mistakes.png"/></a></p>
<p class="measure-wide">All these endless soul-searching are well known to any professional, and the way out of them is not always obvious. Especially if you are angry, tired, and the deadline for the project expired somewhere last week.</p>

    <div class="f4 lh-copy black mb5">
        <p class="measure-wide">Yesterday morning, I was buying gifts for my women. While a florist was makings bouquets for me, we had a small talk and I suddenly caught her eye. She was looking at the growing crowd of customers with calmness and a clearly readable shadow of doom. This is probably how sailors looking at a surging wave which is about to bury their boat :-)</p>
<p class="measure-wide">People outside the flower industry grin sometimes — they say, eight of March is such a magical holiday for all the florists who make a fortune in ten hours. Well, income is really good these days, but literally anybody who has ever worked in this sphere more often associates the holiday (and a couple of days before it, by the way) with a monstrous strain on health and nerves.</p>
<p class="measure-wide">I can say that I got off cheaply: was just deploying and servicing some IT of a local net of flower shops, nothing more (by the way, I want to proudly <a class="link blue dim bb" href="http://rosetta.florist/" target="_blank">recommend</a> my former colleagues!). Nonetheless, the smell of flowers caused me Vietnam syndrome for a long time :-)</p>

    <div class="f4 lh-copy black mb5">
        <p class="measure-wide">There is a good <a class="link blue dim bb" href="http://maximilyahov.ru/blog/all/mne-ok/" target="_blank">note</a> from Maxim Ilyahov about a way of analyzing something which doesn't concern you but annoys you anyway. It's reminded me of an American principle of non-judgemental attitude which I read about a couple of years ago. As for me, it uses different words to make the same point.</p>
<p class="measure-wide">By the way, this principle presents in Russia too — there is even a famous adage “don't be judgemental so you won't be judged”. What a pity for us that it isn't so widespread yet.</p>

<p class="measure-wide">The artist is <a class="link blue dim bb" href="https://www.patreon.com/adamtots" target="_blank">Adam Ellis</a>.</p>
<p class="measure-wide">As for me, it's a great illustration for an everlasting moan “why do you always stare at your smartphone blah blah blah”. A reason is quite simple: people have their friends, books, podcasts, games, and YouTube in their smartphones. It's much more fun than a frowning man or a grim women with guru syndrome next to them, for example.</p>
<p class="measure-wide">The same is true of children. Social networks are full of arguments about it, but a reason is still the same: if a teenager flips through pictures in his phone in front of you, you bore him and a problem obviously is you.</p>
