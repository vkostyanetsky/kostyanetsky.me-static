        <p>I made another <a href="https://obsidian.md" target="_blank">Obsidian</a> plugin, this time for <a href="https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Daily+notes" target="_blank">daily notes</a>. Draws a nice report: what tasks I worked on, what I did, and how much time I spent. I tried to describe how it works in the <a href="https://github.com/vkostyanetsky/ObsidianTimesheet" target="_blank">repository</a>; will be glad if it is useful to someone else!</p>
<p>Funny thing: for the examples in the README, I used issue numbers FBI-1, FBI-2, and so on. This isn't a reference to the X-Files or Twin Peaks — it's just the first thing that came to mind. The fact is that our internal project for the development of FirstBit ERP is called First Bit Internal, abbreviated as FBI. The main pool of tasks we work on lives in it.</p>
<p>We’re already used to it, but our colleagues outside the company always find our screenshots from JIRA or SonarQube amusing. Did you imagine that you were Agent Cooper? Well, I almost don’t even need to :)</p>

    <div class="f4 lh-copy black mb5 measure-wide">
        <p>Following my <a href="https://kostyanetsky.me/notes/obsidian-fastimer" target="_blank">first</a> plugin for Obsidian, I released <a href="https://github.com/vkostyanetsky/ObsidianFoodiary" target="_blank">the second one</a> a couple of weeks ago. Counts calories, proteins, fats, and carbohydrates in food. It helps not to overeat out of nowhere — it’s rather difficult to judge by eye how much you’ve eaten today and whether you can afford that donut.</p>
<p>In short, a useful thing if you:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fatty (like me)</li>
<li>Want to stop being fatty (like me)</li>
<li>You take notes in Obsidian (like me) 🙂</li>
</ol>
<p>In fact, there is a lot of software for this task. I tried some of them but was dissatisfied: it either has terrible design, is bugged, or is constantly trying to sell me a monthly subscription. In short, it's more annoying than helpful. I wanted something native, built into the usual routine; so, if routine settles in Obsidian, then the solution seems to suggest itself.</p>
<p>You can install the plugin directly from the program — the developers have already approved it. Otherwise, everything is simple: you write in a daily note what you ate and how much it weighed, and you receive a simple table sorted by calories with numbers by proteins, fats, and carbohydrates.</p>
<p>There are examples in the repository at the link above.</p>

    <div class="f4 lh-copy black mb5 measure-wide">
        <p>The <a href="https://obsidian.md/" target="_blank">Obsidian</a> developers recently approved one of my TypeScript pet plugins — <a href="https://github.com/vkostyanetsky/ObsidianFastimer" target="_blank">Fastimer</a>. It is an intermittent fasting tracker that adds a new code block to your vault: you enter the start date of the fasting interval and get the date of its finish, the time until this moment, and a list of the zones to be passed.</p>
<p>The block shows an up-to-date picture every time Obsidian renders it, which means you can monitor your progress in real time. When a fasting window ends, you can enter the end date, and the code block will show the result: whether you managed to achieve the goal, how much time you fasted beyond the plan, and so on.</p>
<p>I'm thinking of improving the visual part a bit (currently, everything is displayed as plain text without any design). In addition, I want to add functions for calculating statistics so that you can draw cute graphs like <a href="https://charts.phib.ro/Meta/Charts/Charts+Documentation" target="_blank">Charts </a> and show achievements. I already made the same in implementing the same <a href="https://github.com/vkostyanetsky/Fastimer" target="_blank">application</a> in Python, but I’m unlikely to return to it — it’s easier to solve the task in the Obsidian vault than to roll out an additional utility.</p>
<p>In short, check out the plugin! :) You can find it by name (Fastimer) in the Obsidian library, or install it manually from the repository.</p>

        <p>Released a new <a href="https://github.com/vkostyanetsky/Fastimer/releases/tag/v1.3.1" target="_blank">version</a> of my console timer for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermittent_fasting" target="_blank">intermittent fasting</a>. I wrote this app about a year ago, when I was once again upset by the <a href="https://www.zerolongevity.com/" target="_blank">Zero</a> application for Android: some very primitive functions (like viewing a specific interval) did not work. Oh my gosh, guys, you had one job!</p>
<p>The main difference between 1.3.1 and 1.2.3 is that the console menu has been cut to hell in favor of the good old arguments and options. The menu concept looks convenient only if an application has few features. However, as soon as you take a step forward, the need to answer a list of questions each time you need something starts to irritate you.</p>

    <div class="f4 lh-copy black mb5 measure-wide">
        <p>Usually the idea of developing is simple: the faster it works, the better. For example, the more requests an application manages to execute per unit of time, the faster the task for which these requests are needed will be solved.</p>
<p>However, it also happens the other way around: you need to reduce the number of operations that a program is able to perform. Let's imagine we exchange data with an external service and it bans if we hit it with requests too often. For example: the cloud version of <a href="https://bitrix24.net" target="_blank">Bitrix24</a> requires sending requests to it no more than two per second.</p>
<p>Here is an <a href="https://github.com/vkostyanetsky/OutgoingRequestsLimiter" target="_blank">implementation</a> of such a slowdown, which I wrote last week. There is no queue support; the main solved problem is to execute as many requests as possible without going beyond the limit (taking into account the fact that requests can be made from different sessions).</p>

        <p>Last week I visited Moscow for <a href="https://event.infostart.ru/2021_msk/" target="_blank">Infostart Event 2021</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Listen to numbers of interesting reports — check;</li>
<li>Meet a few cool people in real life — check;</li>
<li>Chat with friends — check!</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result, I suddenly felt rested despite the flights, stress, and fuss. I think it's because I'm working remotely, so it was really cool to look at so many colleagues in real life (not as a stream of electrons, I mean).</p>
<p>In order not to <s>get up</s> to fly twice, I passed the <a href="https://postgrespro.ru/education/exam/DBA1-10" target="_blank">first test</a> for PostgreSQL administration in the PostgresPro office. There are three more tests ahead, and the final one does not exist at all yet — but the walking one will master the road, I guess.</p>

            <h2 class="f2 lh-title"><a class="link blue bb dim" href="https://kostyanetsky.me/notes/tags/done/build-on-github/">Building The Blog on GitHub</a></h2>

            
    
    <div class="f4 lh-copy black mb5 measure-wide">
        <p>For the last year this site has been working on a simple platform: statics, GitHub and my domain. All the pages were pre-generated and placed in a GitHub's <a href="https://github.com/vkostyanetsky/kostyanetsky.me-static" target="_blank">repository</a> with <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a> enabled.</p>
<p>I collected statics using a script. It was working with a list of text files, pedantically arranged in folders. The script rummaged through them and generated HTML files. Then I manually pushed them to the repository.</p>
<p>This scheme worked well, but the number of clicks annoyed me. Here is the script pull, and there is the script pull, and then you have to tinker with the git. I wanted it to be simpler.</p>
<p>At some point, I figured out that not only the deployment of statics, but also the assembly can be shifted onto the shoulders of GitHub. I put together some thoughts and added two more repositories:</p>
<ol>
<li>A <a href="https://github.com/vkostyanetsky/kostyanetsky.me" target="_blank">repository</a> of initial data. Here I put the content of the site: the text files and a bit of metadata (page titles, dates of pages creation, tags for notes, and so on).</li>
<li>A <a href="https://github.com/vkostyanetsky/BlogBuilder" target="_blank">repository</a> of the script for generating statics. In addition to the script itself, I put various assets here (icons, styles, manifests — in general, everything that doesn't need to be generated every time, but you have to “put” it next to the resulting HTML).</li>
</ol>
<p>Then I wrote an <a href="https://github.com/vkostyanetsky/kostyanetsky.me/blob/main/.github/workflows/main.yml" target="_blank">action</a> that wakes up with every push to the repository with the initial data. Shortly, its logic:</p>
<ol>
<li>Clone the repository with statics and the repository with the generating script;</li>
<li>Update the repository with statics using the generating script;</li>
<li>Push changes of the repository with static to the main branch;</li>
<li>Notify the owner (me) via Telegram.</li>
</ol>
<p>Voilà! Now, whenever the repository with the original data changes, the GitHub immediately (well, as soon as possible — within a minute) updates the repository with the site and deploys it via GitHub Pages. A bonus is a web interface to manage the site (in fact, the GitHub site). No Code. :-)</p>
<p>While I'm at it, I added links for editing pages directly to the site (the pencil icon in the upper-right corner). This is intended as a convenience for me, but anyone who finds a typo can send a PR. Thank you in advance!</p>

    <div class="f4 lh-copy black mb5 measure-wide">
        <p>I posted on GitHub a Python <a href="https://github.com/vkostyanetsky/RCloneAbuser" target="_blank">script</a> which I use to sync files between my PC and a NAS. I have a Synology DS220j; a lot of software comes with it, including a backup utility. However, it seems to have been made for show only: the program began to fail even at the setup stage, so I lost confidence in it pretty fast.</p>
<p>I suffered with the problem for some time and eventually returned to the good old <a href="https://rclone.org" target="_blank">rclone</a>, which has only two problems for me. Firstly, I can't normally connect to an SMB share: yes, the login and password can be saved in Windows and rclone will use them, but OS will forget it as soon as possible. I got out of the situation by connecting my NAS as an external drive.</p>
<p>Secondly, I had many files and folders to sync: a directory here, a directory there, a config from there, a profile from here… In order not to produce spaghetti code, I wrote a simple script that takes sources and receivers from a config file, and then executes rclone for each pair.</p>
