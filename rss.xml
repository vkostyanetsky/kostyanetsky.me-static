<p>The colleague grumbled that if you think like that, then the configurator will be Zhiguli, and the EDT will be Kama1 (this is an electric car that has been developed somewhere in the depths of KAMAZ for many years and still can’t gather strength and, finally, show the wonder to the world).</p>
<p>Well, I try to look at things with optimism. I think the platform and its IDE are such haul trucks. No one in their right mind rides them on household chores, but these beasts are irreplaceable on a cut!</p></description>

            <title>Second Monitor Management via Console</title>
            <link>https://kostyanetsky.me/notes/2nd-monitor-and-console</link>

            <description><p>I have two monitors. I use the second one during meetings in Zoom or when playing together with friends (in both cases it's convenient to bring the people's cameras there). There are more examples when it's useful, but often the device is simply idle. In order not to be distracted, I decided to turn it off.</p>
<p>What is the ambush here: it is inconvenient to enable or disable the second monitor via OS (a few clicks, and you need to scroll, and all the time you get confused where to go — in “Screen settings” or “Personalization”). I would like one command, and the command on a hotkey. And, ideally, from the script to rule all this.</p>
<p>I did not find the script, but I found a ready-made utility — MultiMonitorTool. It's free. Works under the Windows 10 without problems. The commands below turn on / off the 2nd monitor:</p>
<pre><code>MultiMonitorTool.exe / disable 2
MultiMonitorTool.exe / enable 2
MultiMonitorTool.exe / switch 2
</code></pre>
<p>For some reason, when you turn on a monitor via enable or switch, it's positioned incorrectly sometimes (for example, before it was turned off, it was on the right, and after turning it on, it was on the left). This is fixable. First, let's save the configuration at the moment when both monitors are on:</p>
<pre><code>MultiMonitorTool.exe / SaveConfig Monitors.cfg
</code></pre>
<p>And then, when you need to turn on the monitor, load the saved config:</p>
<pre><code>MultiMonitorTool.exe / LoadConfig Monitors.cfg
</code></pre>
<p>The utility can do a lot more (for example, one of the commands flips application windows between monitors). Follow the link above for the description.</p></description>

            <description><p>Just finished reading “Harry Potter and Methods of Rationality” — the epic fanfic based on the you-know-whose universe. An author is a tough specialist in the field of artificial intelligence and interesting on his own, but his book is what I insistently <a href="http://hpmor.com/" target="_blank">recommend</a> to read.</p>
<p>First of all, it is the magnificent rethinking of the original saga. Many aspects seem not less fascinating, I may say; moreover, the plot itself is certainly excellent — I read two-thirds of the story without switching <a href="https://kostyanetsky.me/notes/hpmor/gene-wilder-meme.jpg" target="_blank">Gene Wilder</a> off :-) Nevertheless, the author was skillful enough to make all points meet and finish a storyline in such a pretty way that I had almost nothing to complain about.</p>
<p>In any case, this book is a well way to meet with a lot of scientific and just interesting things which were mentioned along the way. The author is smart and his book is a smart one too.</p></description>

            <description><p>Let's speak a bit about organization of the code. If you need to describe a set of objects with common properties, think about whether this description should be divided into separate methods, each of which intended to describe one specific object?</p>
<p>Let's look at this example — a method that describes tabular parts of documents suitable for some task:</p>
<pre><code>SupportedTypes["Document.SupplierPricesEntering"]   = "Prices";
SupportedTypes["Document.OpeningBalancesEntering"]  = "CustomerAccounts,VendorAccounts";
SupportedTypes["Document.Requisition"]              = "InventoryAndServices";
</code></pre>
<p>Everything seems fine, right? Descriptions are there; tabular parts are listed; splitting them by comma doesn't look expensive at all.</p>
<p>However, there are many documents in the method. Eventually, some colleague (or you) will need to refer to another tabular part of the document, which is already mentioned in the method. Something will distract they, they will forget to look for an existing line and something like this will turn out:</p>
<pre><code>SupportedTypes["Document.SupplierPricesEntering"]   = "Prices";
SupportedTypes["Document.OpeningBalancesEntering"]  = "CustomerAccounts,VendorAccounts";
SupportedTypes["Document.Requisition"]              = "InventoryAndServices";

&lt;...&gt;

SupportedTypes["Document.OpeningBalancesEntering"]  = "PayrollDeductions";
</code></pre>
<p>As a result, a part of description will be erased, and it's good if the related functionality is covered by tests.</p>
<p>Conclusion? Well, you can write a helper method that will take the document type and the name of <strong>one</strong> table part as input. The helper will add items to the SupportedTypes map and ensure that the data already added is not lost.</p>
<p>However, if you need a better solution, then consider doing as I wrote at the beginning of this note: split the method into auxiliary methods. One method contains description for one document only (for all its tabular sections). Something like:</p>
<pre><code>Procedure AddOpeningBalancesEnteringDocument(SupportedTypes)

    TabularSections = New Array;

    TabularSections.Add("CustomerAccounts");
    TabularSections.Add("VendorAccounts");
    TabularSections.Add("PayrollDeductions");

    SupportedTypes["Document.Requisition"] = StrConcat(TabularSections, ",");

EndProcedure
</code></pre>
<p>What do we get here? Firstly, nobody will accidentally erase the description of the document. Secondly, SonarQube will be pleased: it is highly likely to begin swearing at repeating literals with the names of tabular parts, if the helper is implemented instead of code splitting.</p></description>

            <description><p>1C:Enterprise has a convenient and accustomed method of showing information for a user — it's a UserMessage object. It outputs messages at the bottom of a form and suddenly it's a potential problem. The thing is, most users don't look at it. It's like: well, I see no critical errors for now so there is nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>Therefore, in case an error happens or you just have an essential message, you should show it through a dialogue window — by the ShowQueryBox() method or a ShowMessageBox() method, for example. Otherwise, a user may not notice a problem and continue to work in spite of some action might not be executed or might be executed in a wrong way. The issue will come out later and you will be rightfully blamed for it.</p>
<p>In addition, using of a UserMessage object should be prohibited in case of small service forms. Yes, in fact, it's hard to overlook a text if a window is small, but that's a different matter: the messages below literally <a href="https://kostyanetsky.me/notes/message-to-user/en.png" target="_blank">devour</a> form's workspace and it becomes hard to work with.</p></description>

            <description><p>The repository login form of the current platform (8.3.22.1923, to be precise) launched with the English interface:</p>
<p><img alt="Login Form" src="https://kostyanetsky.me/notes/do-you-speak-english/login-form.png"/></p>
<p>You had one job, literally.</p>
<p>I heard some rumors that development of the Designer was stopped largely due to the monstrous amount of technical debt that slows down any new features. But here are interface glitches right on one of the first application windows! Curious how it got through the build tests.</p>
<p>Maybe they don't exist at all.</p></description>

            <description><p>Last week I visited Moscow for <a href="https://event.infostart.ru/2021_msk/" target="_blank">Infostart Event 2021</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Listen to numbers of interesting reports — check;</li>
<li>Meet a few cool people in real life — check;</li>
<li>Chat with friends — check!</li>
</ul>
<p>As a result, I suddenly felt rested despite the flights, stress, and fuss. I think it's because I'm working remotely, so it was really cool to look at so many colleagues in real life (not as a stream of electrons, I mean).</p>
<p>In order not to <s>get up</s> to fly twice, I passed the <a href="https://postgrespro.ru/education/exam/DBA1-10" target="_blank">first test</a> for PostgreSQL administration in the PostgresPro office. There are three more tests ahead, and the final one does not exist at all yet — but the walking one will master the road, I guess.</p></description>

            <title>Going Postal</title>

            <description><p>Recently, I was working with vocabulary in an attempt to describe my latest adventures to an English-speaking friend and got to know about the colorful idiom “to go postal”. It means something like “go crazy with anger”; appeared somewhere between the 80s and 90s in the USA after a series of rather <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Going_postal" target="_blank">insane incidents</a> in which postal workers went crazy and attacked people around, including colleagues and visitors.</p>
<p>The expression sounds funny at first glance, but the story behind the scenes is painfully gloomy. I think I will continue to use the good old “to go ballistic”. Literally, “get angry that strong so you become a rocket which lost control”. Or, to simplify, “explode with anger”.</p>
<p>By the way, there are similar rocket-like connotations in Russian, but for some reason they are about a more manageable cases. Mostly, they implies something like "the fire in the ass was so damn strong that the poor guy left Earth and successfully landed on Mars". Sounds a bit better than a simple explosion — you didn't completely waste the precious resource, at least :-)</p></description>

            <title>A Script to Sync With NAS</title>
            <link>https://kostyanetsky.me/notes/rclone-abuser</link>

            <description><p>I posted on GitHub a Python <a href="https://github.com/vkostyanetsky/RCloneAbuser" target="_blank">script</a> which I use to sync files between my PC and a NAS. I have a Synology DS220j; a lot of software comes with it, including a backup utility. However, it seems to have been made for show only: the program began to fail even at the setup stage, so I lost confidence in it pretty fast.</p>
<p>I suffered with the problem for some time and eventually returned to the good old <a href="https://rclone.org" target="_blank">rclone</a>, which has only two problems for me. Firstly, I can't normally connect to an SMB share: yes, the login and password can be saved in Windows and rclone will use them, but OS will forget it as soon as possible. I got out of the situation by connecting my NAS as an external drive.</p>
<p>Secondly, I had many files and folders to sync: a directory here, a directory there, a config from there, a profile from here… In order not to produce spaghetti code, I wrote a simple script that takes sources and receivers from a config file, and then executes rclone for each pair.</p></description>

            <description><p>The more I explore the Bitrix24 REST interface, the more I am amazed at how different its developers mindsets are. It is expressed in different ways.</p>
<p>Let's take, for example, the interface of deals and product rows related to them. There is no amount field in the table of the products: like, you need the amount for each line – count it yourself, that's it. However, there is the amount field at the document level! Can you guess what the field is named?</p>
<p>AMOUNT? DEAL_AMOUNT? DOCUMENT_AMOUNT? AMOUNT_TOTAL?</p>
<p>You didn't guess, the correct answer is OPPORTUNITY.</p>
<p><img alt="What the fuck?" src="https://kostyanetsky.me/notes/strange-bitrix/what-the-fuck.jpg"/></p>
<p>Where'd I digress? Yeah, a product line. It contains a product, a VAT rate, and a unit of measure. All three entities are completely independent: each has a separate table with auxiliary information and its own unique identifier. It is logical to assume that identifiers are stored in the product line: product ID, VAT rate ID, and unit ID.</p>
<p>Well, yes, but no. The product field actually contains ID, but for the VAT rate field it's a rate value. What's for the unit of measure field? Well, it contains a measurement code ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</p>
<p>Database normalization? What? What does it mean? Back off, man, you're distracting us from work.</p></description>
