            <description><p class="measure-wide">A few days ago, there was a link to 1Ci certificate in the team chat (a colleague passed their junior <a class="link blue dim bb" href="https://academy.1ci.com/courses/1c-junior-developer" target="_blank">course</a>). I go over, I get a PDF. Everything is OK, right? Well, then I open the file:</p>
<p class="measure-wide"><img alt="Error.pdf" src="https://kostyanetsky.me/notes/matryoshka/not-your-certificate.png"/></p>
<p class="measure-wide">Honestly? I am even delighted. We need to implement this UX in our products: you press, for example, the “print” button for a document, and it gives you a PDF! And inside it — a link to another PDF! And inside it — “entity is not filled”, so go fill.</p>
<p class="measure-wide">You can sell it as a Russian way of dealing with errors. This is, like, for historical reasons! Blame all the damned matryoshkas, and <a class="link blue dim bb" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koschei" target="_blank">Koschei</a> with his needle. It is, as you remember, in the egg, and it is in the duck, which is in the rabbit, tucked into the chest, and further along the chain of nesting.</p></description>

            <title>Second Monitor Management via Console</title>
            <link>https://kostyanetsky.me/notes/2nd-monitor-and-console/</link>

            <description><p class="measure-wide">I have two monitors. I use the second one during meetings in Zoom or when playing together with friends (in both cases it's convenient to bring the people's cameras there). There are more examples when it's useful, but often the device is simply idle. In order not to be distracted, I decided to turn it off.</p>
<p class="measure-wide">What is the ambush here: it is inconvenient to enable or disable the second monitor via OS (a few clicks, and you need to scroll, and all the time you get confused where to go — in “Screen settings” or “Personalization”). I would like one command, and the command on a hotkey. And, ideally, from the script to rule all this.</p>
<p class="measure-wide">I did not find the script, but I found a ready-made utility — MultiMonitorTool. It's free. Works under the Windows 10 without problems. The commands below turn on / off the 2nd monitor:</p>
<pre><code>MultiMonitorTool.exe / disable 2
MultiMonitorTool.exe / enable 2
MultiMonitorTool.exe / switch 2
</code></pre>
<p class="measure-wide">For some reason, when you turn on a monitor via enable or switch, it's positioned incorrectly sometimes (for example, before it was turned off, it was on the right, and after turning it on, it was on the left). This is fixable. First, let's save the configuration at the moment when both monitors are on:</p>
<pre><code>MultiMonitorTool.exe / SaveConfig Monitors.cfg
</code></pre>
<p class="measure-wide">And then, when you need to turn on the monitor, load the saved config:</p>
<pre><code>MultiMonitorTool.exe / LoadConfig Monitors.cfg
</code></pre>
<p class="measure-wide">The utility can do a lot more (for example, one of the commands flips application windows between monitors). Follow the link above for the description.</p></description>

            <description><blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide">There is a path to a CSV file. You need to open it, read the header (first line), find the Salary column and display the top 10 salaries.</p>
<p class="measure-wide"><em><a class="link blue dim bb" href="https://t.me/nikitonsky_chat/26402" target="_blank">Link</a></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide">Threw in my <a class="link blue dim bb" href="https://gist.github.com/tonsky/881d5d8c4fbed818fe2905a7591a91e0#file-vkostyanetsky-1c" target="_blank">two cents</a> just to complete the picture. If you forget about stability, readability, and performance — you can cut it in half. Here it was obvious from the very beginning that it would be shorter in bash and clearer in Python, so I just wrote it as I was used to.</p>
<p class="measure-wide">What was useful: there are a bunch of examples in other languages ​​in the comments to the post. Frankly speaking, I haven’t come across some of them; it was really curious to look at the syntax and try to understand the way to solve the task.</p>
<p class="measure-wide">In general, the whole story reminded Eugene Stepanishev's <a class="link blue dim bb" href="https://bolknote.ru/tags/beer99/" target="_blank">hobby</a> — to write the output of the American “beer song” in all languages ​​in a row. By the way, Tonsky's issue looks as fun for me too — too trivial to seriously compare something on its basis.</p>
<p class="measure-wide">What was funny: for a couple of <a class="link blue dim bb" href="https://t.me/nikitonsky_pub/201?comment=26703" target="_blank">colleagues</a>, the 1C code caused such acute vision problems that they considered it necessary to report it :-) I partly understand the desire to assert itself on the stereotype “1C is bad, mkay?”, but it's the wrong case. The preference in syntax is nothing but a matter of taste, and besides it, the solution in 1C is no different from solutions in any other language without a built-in library for parsing CSV.</p></description>

            <title>Building This Site on GitHub</title>
            <link>https://kostyanetsky.me/notes/build-on-github/</link>

            <description><p class="measure-wide">For the last year this site has been working on a simple platform: statics, GitHub and my domain. All the pages were pre-generated and placed in a GitHub's <a class="link blue dim bb" href="https://github.com/vkostyanetsky/kostyanetsky.me-static" target="_blank">repository</a> with <a class="link blue dim bb" href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Pages</a> enabled.</p>
<p class="measure-wide">I collected statics using a script. It was working with a list of text files, pedantically arranged in folders. The script rummaged through them and generated HTML files. Then I manually pushed them to the repository.</p>
<p class="measure-wide">This scheme worked well, but the number of clicks annoyed me. Here is the script pull, and there is the script pull, and then you have to tinker with the git. I wanted it to be simpler.</p>
<p class="measure-wide">At some point, I figured out that not only the deployment of statics, but also the assembly can be shifted onto the shoulders of GitHub. I put together some thoughts and added two more repositories:</p>
<ol class="measure-wide">
<li>A <a class="link blue dim bb" href="https://github.com/vkostyanetsky/kostyanetsky.me" target="_blank">repository</a> of initial data. Here I put the content of the site: the text files and a bit of metadata (page titles, dates of pages creation, tags for notes, and so on).</li>
<li>A <a class="link blue dim bb" href="https://github.com/vkostyanetsky/BlogBuilder" target="_blank">repository</a> of the script for generating statics. In addition to the script itself, I put various assets here (icons, styles, manifests — in general, everything that doesn't need to be generated every time, but you have to “put” it next to the resulting HTML).</li>
</ol>
<p class="measure-wide">Then I wrote an <a class="link blue dim bb" href="https://github.com/vkostyanetsky/kostyanetsky.me/blob/main/.github/workflows/main.yml" target="_blank">action</a> that wakes up with every push to the repository with the initial data. Shortly, its logic:</p>
<ol class="measure-wide">
<li>Clone the repository with statics and the repository with the generating script;</li>
<li>Update the repository with statics using the generating script;</li>
<li>Push changes of the repository with static to the main branch;</li>
<li>Notify the owner (me) via Telegram.</li>
</ol>
<p class="measure-wide">Voilà! Now, whenever the repository with the original data changes, the GitHub immediately (well, as soon as possible — within a minute) updates the repository with the site and deploys it via GitHub Pages. A bonus is a web interface to manage the site (in fact, the GitHub site). No Code. :-)</p>
<p class="measure-wide">While I'm at it, I added links for editing pages directly to the site (the pencil icon in the upper-right corner). This is intended as a convenience for me, but anyone who finds a typo can send a PR. Thank you in advance!</p></description>

<p class="measure-wide">The nice episode of the “We Are Doomed” IT podcast about developer burnout. No insights, but you can hear something useful for yourself. I liked the analogy with video games, somewhere close to the middle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="measure-wide">There was such a game — Diablo. RPG, all sorts of spells, you know. A character has mana and health, and when you have no mana to cast… Ha, I sound like a nerd! Well, nevermind. Briefly speaking, when you have no mana to cast, it's taken from your health.</p>

            <description><p class="measure-wide">I was developing payment documents in our configuration last week and came across an incredibly redundant solution to a primitive problem. Sorry, I can't keep to myself.</p>
<p class="measure-wide">Just imagine: you have a document, which contains several tabular sections. Each of them has a comment field. You make a print form for this document; if at least one row of any TS contains a comment — you need to use one template 1, if there are no comments — template 2.</p>
<p class="measure-wide">The task is pretty primitive, isn't it? All of us have done something like this a million times. Just read the selection, use IsBlankString() on the comment field and load the appropriate template. Coffee time!</p>
<p class="measure-wide">However, instead of a short cycle, I saw this:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/vkostyanetsky/e870d5bb3d2f23d93f3d17001eaef59b.js">Gist</script>
<p class="measure-wide">There is a chain of queries, in the lowest of which we scan all the TS (which, I remind you, we just raked out for printing). We are looking for comments in them, then we group the result several times and return it to the script.</p>
<p class="measure-wide">Well, I'm not even talking about the load on the DBMS (I would venture to guess that this trick doesn't give a noticeable effect — after all, the selection is going to be small). It's just… Well… Checking a selection of rows is, like, five lines of code. Clear, simple, short, Sonar has no room to swear. How could you give birth to this? Because of great love for queries?</p>
<p class="measure-wide">You know what? I bet that it's the correct answer. I can almost see this programmer, who has just mastered the query language more or less tolerably. He is in the absolute delight of new opportunities, so… If all you have is a hammer, everything around looks like nails.</p></description>

            <description><p class="measure-wide">I did not notice when I gave up the habit of pedantically commenting on every method with which I have to work. This practice has some clever name for sure, but I don't care, to be honest. I mean the style when a description is added to every meaningful block of code, like this:</p>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/vkostyanetsky/afae4dee09d639f34156d6c02b29c2a5.js">Gist</script>
<p class="measure-wide">The meaning here is simple: when you dig in some dense legacy and run back and forth between chaotically scattered, big procedures — it is rather difficult to keep the logic of each of them in your head. The next cup of coffee will wash everything away. Therefore, such notes greatly speed up orientation on the ground, and the more time passes between approaches to the code, the more noticeable the effect.</p>
<p class="measure-wide">However, at some point it became clear that this know-how is just a crutch supporting the frankly crappy code design. If you have a long procedure or function - take a breath, sit down and cut the fatty one into smaller methods. You will save both time and nerves, and you will figure out the code faster, and you will delight SonarCube.</p></description>

<p class="measure-wide">On the screenshot above my little one is just letting me know where she is: walking down the street, at the school, at a playground. It's not her fault that I have a sort of nerd view: when I look at this chat I see nothing but code on Gherkin, which is just a bit broken. A little patch here and there and it will be fine :-)</p>
<pre><code>And I exit home
Then I enter school
And I exit school
Then I gonna swing
</code></pre>
<p class="measure-wide">We use Gherkin to write our autotests for <a class="link blue dim bb" href="https://github.com/Pr-Mex/vanessa-automation" target="_blank">Vanessa Automation</a>. I can't say I've made very many of them, especially in comparison with some of my colleagues… Well, it seems like I've made them enough to twist the reality a few.</p></description>

            <description><p class="measure-wide">Yesterday morning, I was buying gifts for my women. While a florist was makings bouquets for me, we had a small talk and I suddenly caught her eye. She was looking at the growing crowd of customers with calmness and a clearly readable shadow of doom. This is probably how sailors looking at a surging wave which is about to bury their boat :-)</p>
<p class="measure-wide">People outside the flower industry grin sometimes — they say, eight of March is such a magical holiday for all the florists who make a fortune in ten hours. Well, income is really good these days, but literally anybody who has ever worked in this sphere more often associates the holiday (and a couple of days before it, by the way) with a monstrous strain on health and nerves.</p>
<p class="measure-wide">I can say that I got off cheaply: was just deploying and servicing some IT of a local net of flower shops, nothing more (by the way, I want to proudly <a class="link blue dim bb" href="http://rosetta.florist/" target="_blank">recommend</a> my former colleagues!). Nonetheless, the smell of flowers caused me Vietnam syndrome for a long time :-)</p></description>

<p class="measure-wide">You're sliding down the side of a mountain and trying to feel an equilibrium point, for the hundredth time. However, your nagging back is the only thing you're able to feel, and the Vaas speech from Far Cry 3 isn't going out of your mind.</p>

<p class="measure-wide">Did I ever tell you what the definition of insanity is? Insanity is doing the exact… Same fucking thing… Over and over again expecting… Shit to change… That. Is. Crazy.</p>

<p class="measure-wide">Surprisingly, you're certainly satisfied with the trip when it's done.</p>
